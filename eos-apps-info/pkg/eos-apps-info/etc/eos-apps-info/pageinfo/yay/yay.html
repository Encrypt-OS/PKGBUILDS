<p><em>yay</em></p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>Yay is a Pacman wrapper with AUR support. It passes options to
Makepkg and Pacman after resolving packages to install/upgrade.</p>
<p>This manpage only covers options unique to Yay. For other options see
<strong>pacman(8)</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="yay-operations">Yay operations</h2>
<p><strong>-Y, --yay</strong><br />
Perform yay specific operations. This is the default if no other
operation is selected.</p>
<p><strong>-P, --show</strong><br />
Perform yay specific print operations.</p>
<p><strong>-G, --getpkgbuild</strong><br />
Downloads PKGBUILD from ABS or AUR. The ABS can only be used for Arch
Linux repositories</p>
<p>If no arguments are provided 'yay -Syu' will be performed.</p>
<p>If no operation is selected -Y will be assumed.</p>
<h2 id="extended-pacman-operations">Extended pacman operations</h2>
<p><strong>-S, -Si, -Sl, -Ss, -Su, -Sc, -Qu</strong><br />
These operations are extended to support both AUR and repo packages.</p>
<p><strong>-Sc</strong><br />
Yay will also clean cached AUR package and any untracked Files in the
cache. Cleaning untracked files will wipe any downloaded sources or
built packages but will keep already downloaded vcs sources.</p>
<p><strong>-R</strong><br />
Yay will also remove cached data about devel packages.</p>
<h2 id="new-options">New options</h2>
<p><strong>--repo</strong><br />
Assume all targets are from the repositories. Additionally Actions such
as sysupgrade will only act on repository packages.</p>
<p><strong>-a, --aur</strong><br />
Assume all targets are from the AUR. Additionally Actions such as
sysupgrade will only act on AUR packages.</p>
<p>Note that dependency resolving will still act normally and include
repository packages.</p>
<h2 id="yay-options-apply-to--y-and---yay">Yay options (apply to -y and
--yay)</h2>
<p><strong>&lt;NO OPTION&gt;</strong><br />
Displays a list of packages matching the search terms and prompts the
user on which packages to install (yogurt mode).</p>
<p><strong>--gendb</strong><br />
Generate development package database. Tracks the latest commit for each
development package, when there is a new commit Yay will know to update.
This is done per package whenever a package is synced. This option
should only be used when migrating to Yay from another AUR helper.</p>
<p><strong>-c, --clean</strong><br />
Remove unneeded dependencies.</p>
<h2 id="show-options-apply-to--p-and---show">Show options (apply to -p
and --show)</h2>
<p><strong>-c, --complete</strong><br />
Print a list of all AUR and repo packages. This allows shell completion
and is not intended to be used directly by the user.</p>
<p><strong>-f, --fish</strong><br />
During complete adjust the output for the fish shell.</p>
<p><strong>-d, --defaultconfig</strong><br />
Print default yay configuration.</p>
<p><strong>-g, --currentconfig</strong><br />
Print current yay configuration.</p>
<p><strong>-n, --numberupgrades</strong><br />
Deprecated, use <strong>yay -Qu</strong> and <strong>wc -l</strong>
instead.</p>
<p><strong>-s, --stats</strong><br />
Displays information about installed packages and system health. If
there are orphaned, or out-of-date packages, or packages that no longer
exist on the AUR; warnings will be displayed.</p>
<p><strong>-u, --upgrades</strong><br />
Deprecated, use <strong>yay -Qu</strong> instead.</p>
<p><strong>-w, --news</strong><br />
Print new news from the Archlinux homepage. News is considered new if it
is newer than the build date of all native packages. Pass this twice to
show all available news.</p>
<p><strong>-q, --quiet</strong><br />
Only show titles when printing news.</p>
<h2 id="getpkgbuild-options-apply-to--g-and---getpkgbuild">Getpkgbuild
options (apply to -g and --getpkgbuild)</h2>
<p><strong>-f, --force</strong><br />
Force download for ABS packages that already exist in the current
directory. This ensures directories are not accidentally
overwritten.</p>
<p><strong>-p, --print</strong><br />
Prints the PKGBUILD of the given packages to stdout.</p>
<h2 id="permanent-configuration-settings">Permanent configuration
settings</h2>
<p><strong>--save</strong><br />
Causes the following options to be saved back to the config file. This
provides an easy way to change config options without directly editing
the file.</p>
<p><strong>--aururl</strong><br />
Set an alternative AUR URL. This is mostly useful for users in China who
wish to use <a
href="https://aur.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/">https://aur.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/</a>.</p>
<p><strong>--builddir &lt;dir&gt;</strong><br />
Directory to use for Building AUR Packages. This directory is also used
as the AUR cache when deciding if Yay should skip builds.</p>
<p><strong>--editor &lt;command&gt;</strong><br />
Editor to use when editing PKGBUILDs. If this is not set the
<strong>EDITOR</strong> environment variable will be checked, followed
by <strong>VISUAL</strong>. If none of these are set Yay will prompt the
user for an editor.</p>
<p><strong>--editorflags &lt;flags&gt;</strong><br />
Passes arguments to the editor. These flags get passed to every instance
where the editor is called by Yay. Arguments are split on whitespace
before being passed to the editor. Multiple arguments may be passed by
supplying a space separated list that is quoted by the shell.</p>
<p><strong>--makepkg &lt;command&gt;</strong><br />
The command to use for <strong>makepkg</strong> calls. This can be a
command in <strong>PATH</strong> or an absolute path to the file.</p>
<p><strong>--pacman &lt;command&gt;</strong><br />
The command to use for <strong>pacman</strong> calls. This can be a
command in <strong>PATH</strong> or an absolute path to the file.</p>
<p><strong>--tar &lt;command&gt;</strong><br />
The command to use for <strong>bsdtar</strong> calls. This can be a
command in <strong>PATH</strong> or an absolute path to the file.</p>
<p><strong>--git &lt;command&gt;</strong><br />
The command to use for <strong>git</strong> calls. This can be a command
in <strong>PATH</strong> or an absolute path to the file.</p>
<p><strong>--gpg &lt;command&gt;</strong><br />
The command to use for <strong>gpg</strong> calls. This can be a command
in <strong>PATH</strong> or an absolute path to the file.</p>
<p><strong>--config &lt;file&gt;</strong><br />
The pacman config file to use.</p>
<p><strong>--makepkgconf &lt;file&gt;</strong><br />
The config file for makepkg to use. If this is not set then the default
config file will be used.</p>
<p><strong>--nomakepkgconf</strong><br />
Reset the makepkg config file back to its default.</p>
<p><strong>--requestsplitn &lt;number&gt;</strong><br />
The maximum amount of packages to request per AUR query. The higher the
number the faster AUR requests will be. Requesting too many packages in
one AUR query will cause an error. This should only make a noticeable
difference with very large requests (&gt;500) packages.</p>
<p><strong>--completioninterval &lt;days&gt;</strong><br />
Time in days to refresh the completion cache. Setting this to 0 will
cause the cache to be refreshed every time, while setting this to -1
will cause the cache to never be refreshed.</p>
<p><strong>--sortby
&lt;votes|popularity|id|baseid|name|base|submitted|modified&gt;</strong><br />
Sort AUR results by a specific field during search.</p>
<p><strong>--searchby
&lt;name|name-desc|maintainer|depends|checkdepends|makedepends|optdepends&gt;</strong><br />
Search for AUR packages by querying the specified field.</p>
<p><strong>--answerclean
&lt;All|None|Installed|NotInstalled|...&gt;</strong><br />
Set a predetermined answer for the clean build menu question. This
answer will be used instead of reading from standard input but will be
parsed exactly the same.</p>
<p><strong>--answerdiff
&lt;All|None|Installed|NotInstalled|...&gt;</strong><br />
Set a predetermined answer for the edit diff menu question. This answer
will be used instead of reading from standard input but will be parsed
exactly the same.</p>
<p><strong>--answeredit
&lt;All|None|Installed|NotInstalled|...&gt;</strong><br />
Set a predetermined answer for the edit pkgbuild menu question. This
answer will be used instead of reading from standard input but will be
parsed exactly the same.</p>
<p><strong>--answerupgrade &lt;Repo|^Repo|None|...&gt;</strong><br />
Set a predetermined answer for the upgrade menu question. Selects which
package ranges or repos to omit for updates. This answer will be used
instead of reading from standard input but will be treated exactly the
same.</p>
<p><strong>--noanswerclean</strong><br />
Unset the answer for the clean build menu.</p>
<p><strong>--noanswerdiff</strong><br />
Unset the answer for the diff menu.</p>
<p><strong>--noansweredit</strong><br />
Unset the answer for the edit pkgbuild menu.</p>
<p><strong>--noanswerupgrade</strong><br />
Unset the answer for the upgrade menu.</p>
<p><strong>--cleanmenu</strong><br />
Show the clean menu. This menu gives you the chance to fully delete the
downloaded build files from Yay's cache before redownloading a fresh
copy.</p>
<p><strong>--diffmenu</strong><br />
Show the diff menu. This menu gives you the option to view diffs from
build files before building.</p>
<p>Diffs are shown via <strong>git diff</strong> which uses less by
default. This behaviour can be changed via git's config, the
<strong>$GIT_PAGER</strong> or <strong>$PAGER</strong> environment
variables.</p>
<p><strong>--editmenu</strong><br />
Show the edit menu. This menu gives you the option to edit or view
PKGBUILDs before building.</p>
<p><strong>Warning</strong>: Yay resolves dependencies ahead of time via
the RPC. It is not recommended to edit pkgbuild variables unless you
know what you are doing.</p>
<p><strong>--upgrademenu</strong><br />
Show a detailed list of updates in a similar format to VerbosePkgLists.
Upgrades can also be skipped using numbers, number ranges or repo names.
Additionally ^ can be used to invert the selection.</p>
<p><strong>Warning</strong>: It is not recommended to skip updates from
the repositories as this can lead to partial upgrades. This feature is
intended to easily skip AUR updates on the fly that may be broken or
have a long compile time. Ultimately it is up to the user what upgrades
they skip.</p>
<p><strong>--nocleanmenu</strong><br />
Do not show the clean menu.</p>
<p><strong>--nodiffmenu</strong><br />
Do not show the diff menu.</p>
<p><strong>--noeditmenu</strong><br />
Do not show the edit menu.</p>
<p><strong>--noupgrademenu</strong><br />
Do not show the upgrade menu.</p>
<p><strong>--askremovemake</strong><br />
Ask to remove makedepends after installing packages.</p>
<p><strong>--removemake</strong><br />
Remove makedepends after installing packages.</p>
<p><strong>--noremovemake</strong><br />
Do not remove makedepends after installing packages.</p>
<p><strong>--topdown</strong><br />
Display repository packages first and then AUR packages.</p>
<p><strong>--bottomup</strong><br />
Show AUR packages first and then repository packages.</p>
<p><strong>--singlelineresults</strong><br />
Override pacman's usual double-line search result format and list each
result on its own line.</p>
<p><strong>--doublelineresults</strong><br />
Follow pacman's double-line search result format and list each result
using two lines.</p>
<p><strong>--devel</strong><br />
During sysupgrade also check AUR development packages for updates.
Currently only Git packages are supported.</p>
<p>Devel checking is done using <strong>git ls-remote</strong>. The
newest commit hash is compared against the hash at install time. This
allows devel updates to be checked almost instantly and not require the
original pkgbuild to be downloaded.</p>
<p>The slower pacaur-like devel checks can be implemented manually by
piping a list of packages into yay (see <strong>examples</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>--nodevel</strong><br />
Do not check for development packages updates during sysupgrade.</p>
<p><strong>--cleanafter</strong><br />
Remove untracked files after installation.</p>
<p>Untracked files are removed with the exception of directories. This
allows VCS packages to easily pull an update instead of having to
reclone the entire repo.</p>
<p><strong>--nocleanafter</strong><br />
Do not remove package sources after successful Install.</p>
<p><strong>--timeupdate</strong><br />
During sysupgrade also compare the build time of installed packages
against the last modification time of each package's AUR page.</p>
<p><strong>--notimeupdate</strong><br />
Do not consider build times during sysupgrade.</p>
<p><strong>--redownload</strong><br />
Always download pkgbuilds of targets even when a copy is available in
cache.</p>
<p><strong>--redownloadall</strong><br />
Always download pkgbuilds of all AUR packages even when a copy is
available in cache.</p>
<p><strong>--noredownload</strong><br />
When downloading pkgbuilds if the pkgbuild is found in cache and is
equal or newer than the AUR's version use that instead of downloading a
new one.</p>
<p><strong>--provides</strong><br />
Look for matching providers when searching for AUR packages. When
multiple providers are found a menu will appear prompting you to pick
one. This increases dependency resolve time although this should not be
noticeable.</p>
<p><strong>--noprovides</strong><br />
Do not look for matching providers when searching for AUR packages. Yay
will never show its provider menu but Pacman will still show its
provider menu for repo packages.</p>
<p><strong>--pgpfetch</strong><br />
Prompt to import unknown PGP keys from the <strong>validpgpkeys</strong>
field of each PKGBUILD.</p>
<p><strong>--nopgpfetch</strong><br />
Do not prompt to import unknown PGP keys. This is likely to cause a
build failure unless using options such as
<strong>--skippgpcheck</strong> or a customized gpg config.</p>
<p><strong>--useask</strong><br />
Use pacman's --ask flag to automatically confirm package conflicts. Yay
lists conflicts ahead of time. It is possible that Yay does not detect a
conflict, causing a package to be removed without the user's
confirmation. However, this is very unlikely.</p>
<p><strong>--nouseask</strong><br />
Manually resolve package conflicts during the install. Packages which do
not conflict will not need to be confined manually.</p>
<p><strong>--combinedupgrade</strong><br />
During sysupgrade, Yay will first perform a refresh, then show its
combined menu of repo and AUR packages that will be upgraded. Then after
reviewing the pkgbuilds, the repo and AUR upgrade will start with no
need for manual intervention.</p>
<p>If Yay exits for any reason After the refresh without upgrading. It
is then the user's responsibility to either resolve the reason Yay
exited or run a sysupgrade through pacman directly.</p>
<p><strong>--nocombinedupgrade</strong><br />
During sysupgrade, Pacman -Syu will be called, then the AUR upgrade will
start. This means the upgrade menu and pkgbuild review will be performed
after the sysupgrade has finished.</p>
<p><strong>--batchinstall</strong><br />
When building and installing AUR packages instead of installing each
package after building, queue each package for install. Then once either
all packages are built or a package in the build queue is needed as a
dependency to build another package, install all the packages in the
install queue.</p>
<p><strong>--nobatchinstall</strong><br />
Always install AUR packages immediately after building them.</p>
<p><strong>--rebuild</strong><br />
Always build target packages even when a copy is available in cache.</p>
<p><strong>--rebuildall</strong><br />
Always build all AUR packages even when a copy is available in
cache.</p>
<p><strong>--rebuildtree</strong><br />
When installing an AUR package rebuild and reinstall all of its AUR
dependencies recursively, even the ones already installed. This flag
allows you to easily rebuild packages against your current system's
libraries if they have become incompatible.</p>
<p><strong>--norebuild</strong><br />
When building packages if the package is found in cache and is an equal
version to the one wanted skip the package build and use the existing
package.</p>
<p><strong>--mflags &lt;flags&gt;</strong><br />
Passes arguments to makepkg. These flags get passed to every instance
where makepkg is called by Yay. Arguments are split on whitespace before
being passed to makepkg. Multiple arguments may be passed by supplying a
space separated list that is quoted by the shell.</p>
<p><strong>--gpgflags &lt;flags&gt;</strong><br />
Passes arguments to gpg. These flags get passed to every instance where
gpg is called by Yay. Arguments are split on whitespace before being
passed to gpg. Multiple arguments may be passed by supplying a space
separated list that is quoted by the shell.</p>
<p><strong>--sudo &lt;command&gt;</strong><br />
The command to use for <strong>sudo</strong> calls. This can be a
command in <strong>PATH</strong> or an absolute path to the file. The
sudoloop is not guaranteed to work with a custom <strong>sudo</strong>
command.</p>
<p><strong>--sudoflags &lt;flags&gt;</strong><br />
Passes arguments to sudo. These flags get passed to every instance where
sudo is called by Yay. Arguments are split on whitespace before being
passed to sudo. Multiple arguments may be passed by supplying a space
separated list that is quoted by the shell.</p>
<p><strong>--sudoloop</strong><br />
Loop sudo calls in the background to prevent sudo from timing out during
long builds.</p>
<p><strong>--nosudoloop</strong><br />
Do not loop sudo calls in the background.</p>
