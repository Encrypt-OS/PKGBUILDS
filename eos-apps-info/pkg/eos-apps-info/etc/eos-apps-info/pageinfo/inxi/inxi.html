<strong>-OPTION(s)</strong></p>
<p>All short form options have long form variants - see below for these
and more advanced options.</p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p><strong>inxi</strong> is a command line system information script
built for console and IRC. It is also used a debugging tool for forum
technical support to quickly ascertain users' system configurations and
hardware. inxi shows system hardware, CPU, drivers, Xorg, Desktop,
Kernel, gcc version(s), Processes, RAM usage, and a wide variety of
other useful information.</p>
<p><strong>inxi</strong> output varies depending on whether it is being
used on CLI or IRC, with some default filters and color options applied
only for IRC use. Script colors can be turned off if desired with
<strong>-c 0</strong>, or changed using the <strong>-c</strong> color
options listed in the STANDARD OPTIONS section below.</p>
<h2 id="privacy-and-security">Privacy and security</h2>
<p>In order to maintain basic privacy and security, inxi used on IRC
automatically filters out your network device MAC address, WAN and LAN
IP, your <strong>/home</strong> username directory in partitions, and a
few other items.</p>
<p>Because inxi is often used on forums for support, you can also
trigger this filtering with the <strong>-z</strong> option
(<strong>-Fz</strong>, for example). To override the IRC filter, you can
use the <strong>-Z</strong> option. This can be useful in debugging
network connection issues online in a private chat, for example.</p>
<h2 id="using-options">Using options</h2>
<p>Options can be combined if they do not conflict. You can either group
the letters together or separate them.</p>
<p>Letters with numbers can have no gap or a gap at your discretion,
except when using ** -t**. Note that if you use an option that requires
an additional argument, that must be last in the short form group of
options. Otherwise you can use those separately as well.</p>
<p>For example: <strong>inxi -AG</strong> | <strong>inxi -A -G</strong>
| <strong>inxi -b</strong> | <strong>inxi -c10</strong> | <strong>inxi
-FxxzJy90</strong> | <strong>inxi -bay</strong></p>
<p>Note that all the short form options have long form equivalents,
which are listed below. However, usually the short form is used in
examples in order to keep things simple.</p>
<p>These are available options sections:</p>
<p>* <strong>STANDARD OPTIONS</strong> Primary data types trigger
items.</p>
<p>* <strong>FILTER OPTIONS</strong> Apply a variety of output
filters.</p>
<p>* <strong>OUTPUT CONTROL OPTIONS</strong> Change default colors,
widths, heights, output types, etc.</p>
<p>* <strong>EXTRA DATA OPTIONS</strong> What <strong>-x</strong>,
<strong>-xx</strong>, <strong>-xxx</strong>, and <strong>-a</strong> add
to the output.</p>
<p>* <strong>ADVANCED OPTIONS</strong> Modify behavior or choice of data
sources, and other advanced switches.</p>
<p>* <strong>DEBUGGING OPTIONS</strong> For development use mainly, or
contributing datasets to the project.</p>
<h2 id="standard-options">Standard options</h2>
<p><strong>-A , <strong>--audio</strong></strong><br />
Show Audio/sound device(s) information, including device driver. Show
running sound server(s). See <strong>-xxA</strong> to show all sound
servers detected.</p>
<p><strong>-b , <strong>--basic</strong></strong><br />
Show basic output, short form. Same as: <strong>inxi -v 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>-B , <strong>--battery</strong></strong><br />
Show system battery (<strong>ID-x</strong>) data, charge, condition,
plus extra information (if battery present). Uses <strong>/sys</strong>
or, for BSDs without systctl battery data, use
<strong>--dmidecode</strong> to force its use.
<strong>dmidecode</strong> does not have very much information, and none
about current battery state/charge/voltage. Supports multiple batteries
when using <strong>/sys</strong> or <strong>sysctl</strong> data.</p>
<p>Note that for <strong>charge:</strong>, the output shows the current
charge, as well as its value as a percentage of the available capacity,
which can be less than the original design capacity. In the following
example, the actual current available capacity of the battery is
<strong>22.2 Wh</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>charge: 20.1 Wh (95.4%)</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>condition:</strong> item shows the remaining available
capacity / original design capacity, and then this figure as a
percentage of original capacity available in the battery.</p>
<p><strong>condition: 22.2/36.4 Wh (61%)</strong></p>
<p>With <strong>-x</strong>, or if voltage difference is critical,
<strong>volts:</strong> item shows the current voltage, and the
<strong>min:</strong> voltage. Note that if the current is below the
minimum listed the battery is essentially dead and will not charge. Test
that to confirm, but that's technically how it's supposed to work.</p>
<p><strong>volts: 12.0 min: 11.4</strong></p>
<p>With <strong>-x</strong> shows attached <strong>Device-x</strong>
information (mouse, keyboard, etc.) if they are battery powered.</p>
<p><strong>--bluetooth</strong></p>
<p>See <strong>-E</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>-c , <strong>--color</strong></strong></p>
<p>See <strong>OUTPUT CONTROL OPTIONS</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>-C , <strong>--cpu</strong></strong><br />
Show full CPU output (if each item available): basic CPU topology,
model, type, L2 cache, average speed of all cores (if &gt; 1 core,
otherwise speed of the core), min/max speeds for CPU, and per CPU clock
speed. More data available with <strong>-x</strong>,
<strong>-xxx</strong>, and <strong>-a</strong> options.</p>
<p>Explanation of CPU type (<strong>type: MT MCP</strong>)
abbreviations:</p>
<p>* <strong>AMCP</strong> - Asymmetric Multi Core Processor. More than
1 core per CPU, and more than one core type (single and multithreaded
cores in the same CPU).</p>
<p>* <strong>AMP</strong> - Asymmetric Multi Processing (more than 1
physical CPU, but not identical in terms of core counts or min/max
speeds).</p>
<p>* <strong>MT</strong> - Multi/Hyper Threaded CPU (more than 1 thread
per core, previously <strong>HT</strong>).</p>
<p>* <strong>MST</strong> - Multi and Single Threaded CPU (a CPU with
both Single and Multi Threaded cores).</p>
<p>* <strong>MCM</strong> - Multi Chip Model (more than 1 die per
CPU).</p>
<p>* <strong>MCP</strong> - Multi Core Processor (more than 1 core per
CPU).</p>
<p>* <strong>SMP</strong> - Symmetric Multi Processing (more than 1
physical CPU).</p>
<p>* <strong>UP</strong> - Uni (single core) Processor.</p>
<p>Note that <strong>min/max:</strong> speeds are not necessarily true
in cases of overclocked CPUs or CPUs in turbo/boost mode. See
<strong>-Ca</strong> for alternate <strong>base/boost:</strong> speed
data, more granular cache data, and more.</p>
<p>Sample:</p>
<pre><code>CPU:
  Info: 2x 8-core model: Intel Xeon E5-2620 v4 bits: 64 type: MT MCP SMP
    cache: L2: 2x 2 MiB (4 MiB)
  Speed (MHz): avg: 1601 min/max: 1200/3000 cores: 1: 1280 2: 1595 3: 1416
    ... 32: 1634</code></pre>
<p><strong>-d ,
<strong>--disk-full</strong>,</strong>--optical****<br />
Show optical drive data as well as <strong>-D</strong> hard drive data.
With <strong>-x</strong>, adds a feature line to the output. Also shows
floppy disks if present. Note that there is no current way to get any
information about the floppy device that we are aware of, so it will
simply show the floppy ID without any extra data. <strong>-xx</strong>
adds a few more features.</p>
<p><strong>-D , <strong>--disk</strong></strong><br />
Show Hard Disk info. Shows total disk space and used percentage. The
disk used percentage includes space used by swap partition(s), since
those are not usable for data storage. Also, unmounted partitions are
not counted in disk use percentages since inxi has no access to the used
amount.</p>
<p>If the system has RAID or other logical storage, and if inxi can
determine the size of those vs their components, you will see the
storage total raw and usable sizes, plus the percent used of the usable
size. The no argument short form of inxi will show only the usable (or
total if no usable) and used percent. If there is no logical storage
detected, only <strong>total:</strong> and <strong>used:</strong> will
show. Sample (with RAID logical size calculated):</p>
<p>**Local Storage: total: raw: 5.49 TiB usable: 2.80 TiB used: 1.35 TiB
** (48.3%)</p>
<p>Without logical storage detected:</p>
<p><strong>Local Storage: total: 2.89 TiB used: 1.51 TiB
(52.3%)</strong></p>
<p>Also shows per disk information: Disk ID, type (if present), vendor
(if detected), model, and size. See <strong>Extra Data Options</strong>
(<strong>-x</strong> options) and <strong>Admin Extra Data
Options</strong> (<strong>--admin</strong> options) for many more
features.</p>
<p><strong>-E, <strong>--bluetooth</strong></strong><br />
Show bluetooth device(s), drivers. Show <strong>Report:</strong> with
HCI ID, state, address per device (requires <strong>bt-adapter</strong>
or <strong>hciconfig</strong>), and if available (hciconfig only)
bluetooth version (<strong>bt-v</strong>). See <strong>Extra Data
Options</strong> for more.</p>
<p>If bluetooth shows as <strong>status: down</strong>, shows
<strong>bt-service: state</strong> and rfkill software and hardware
blocked states, and rfkill ID.</p>
<p>Note that <strong>Report-ID:</strong> indicates that the HCI item was
not able to be linked to a specific device, similar to
<strong>IF-ID:</strong> in <strong>-n</strong>.</p>
<p>If your internal bluetooth device does not show, it's possible that
it has been disabled, if you try enabling it using for example:</p>
<p><strong>hciconfig hci0 up</strong></p>
<p>and it returns a blocked by RF-Kill error, you can do one of
these:</p>
<p><strong>connmanctl enable bluetooth</strong></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><strong>rfkill list bluetooth</strong></p>
<p><strong>rfkill unblock bluetooth</strong></p>
<p><strong>--filter, <strong>-z</strong></strong></p>
<p>See <strong>FILTER OPTIONS</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>-f , <strong>--flags</strong></strong><br />
Show all CPU flags used, not just the short list. Not shown with
<strong>-F</strong> in order to avoid spamming. ARM CPUs: show
<strong>features</strong> items.</p>
<p><strong>-F , <strong>--full</strong></strong><br />
Show Full output for inxi. Includes all Upper Case line letters (except
<strong>-J</strong> and <strong>-W</strong>) plus
<strong>--swap</strong>, <strong>-s</strong> and <strong>-n</strong>.
Does not show extra verbose options such as **-d -f -i -J -l -m -o -p -r
-t -u ** -x unless you use those arguments in the command, e.g.:
<strong>inxi -Frmxx</strong></p>
<p><strong>-G , <strong>--graphics</strong></strong><br />
Show Graphic device(s) information, including details of device and
display drivers (<strong>X:</strong> <strong>loaded:</strong>, and, if
applicable: <strong>unloaded:</strong>, <strong>failed:</strong>, and
active <strong>gpu:</strong> drivers), display protocol (if available),
display server (and/or Wayland compositor), vendor and version number,
e.g.:</p>
<p><strong>Display: x11 server: Xorg v: 1.15.1</strong></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><strong>Display: wayland server: X.org v: 1.20.1 with: Xwayland v:
20.1</strong></p>
<p>If protocol is not detected, shows:</p>
<p><strong>Display: server: Xorg 1.15.1</strong></p>
<p>Also shows screen resolution(s) (per monitor/X screen). For X.org:
OpenGL renderer, OpenGL core profile version/OpenGL version; for VESA:
data (for Xvesa); for Wayland: GBM/EGL data (not implemented).</p>
<p>Compositor information will show if detected using
<strong>-xx</strong> option or always if detected and Wayland since the
compositor is the server with Wayland.</p>
<p><strong>-Gxx</strong> shows monitor data as well, if detected.</p>
<p><strong>-h , <strong>--help</strong></strong><br />
The help menu. Features dynamic sizing to fit into terminal window. Set
script global <strong>COLS_MAX_CONSOLE</strong> if you want a different
default value, or use <strong>-y &lt;width&gt;</strong> to temporarily
override the defaults or actual window width.</p>
<p><strong>-i , <strong>--ip</strong></strong><br />
Show WAN IP address and local interfaces (latter requires
<strong>ifconfig</strong> or <strong>ip</strong> network tool), as well
as network output from <strong>-n</strong>. Not shown with
<strong>-F</strong> for user security reasons. You shouldn't paste your
local/WAN IP. Shows both IPv4 and IPv6 link IP addresses.</p>
<p><strong>-I , <strong>--info</strong></strong><br />
Show Information: processes, uptime, memory, IRC client (or shell type
if run in shell, not IRC), inxi version. See <strong>-Ix</strong>,
<strong>-Ixx</strong>, and <strong>-Ia</strong> for extra information
(init type/version, runlevel, packages).</p>
<p>Note: if <strong>-m</strong> is used or triggered, the memory item
will show in the main Memory: report of <strong>-m</strong>, not in
<strong>Info:</strong>.</p>
<p>Raspberry Pi only: uses <strong>vcgencmd get_mem gpu</strong> to get
gpu RAM amount, if user is in video group and <strong>vcgencmd</strong>
is installed. Uses this result to increase the <strong>Memory:</strong>
amount and <strong>used:</strong> amounts.</p>
<p><strong>-j, <strong>--swap</strong></strong><br />
Shows all active swap types (partition, file, zram). When this option is
used, swap partition(s) will not show on the <strong>-P</strong> line to
avoid redundancy.</p>
<p>To show partition labels or UUIDs (when available and relevant), use
with <strong>-l</strong> or** -u**.</p>
<p><strong>-J , <strong>--usb</strong></strong><br />
Show USB data for attached Hubs and Devices. Hubs also show number of
ports. Be aware that a port is not always external, some may be
internal, and either used or unused (for example, a motherboard USB
header connector that is not used).</p>
<p>Hubs and Devices are listed in order of BusID.</p>
<p>BusID is generally in this format:
BusID-port[.port][.port]:DeviceID</p>
<p>Device ID is a number created by the kernel, and has no necessary
ordering or sequence connection, but can be used to match this output to
lsusb values, which generally shows BusID / DeviceID (except for tree
view, which shows ports).</p>
<p>Examples: <strong>Device-3: 4-3.2.1:2</strong> or <strong>Hub:
4-0:1</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>rev: 2.0</strong> item refers to the USB revision number,
like <strong>1.0</strong> or <strong>3.1</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>-l , <strong>--label</strong></strong><br />
Show partition labels. Use with <strong>-j</strong>,
<strong>-o</strong>, <strong>-p</strong>, and <strong>-P</strong> to
show partition labels. Does nothing without one of those options.</p>
<p>Sample: <strong>-ojpl</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>-L, <strong>--logical</strong></strong><br />
Show Logical volume information, for LVM, LUKS, bcache, etc. Shows size,
free space (for LVM VG). For LVM, shows <strong>Device-[xx]:
VG:</strong> (Volume Group) size/free, <strong>LV-[xx]</strong> (Logical
Volume). LV shows type, size, and components. Note that components are
made up of either containers (aka, logical devices), or physical
devices. The full report requires doas/sudo/root.</p>
<p>Logical block devices can be thought of as devices that are made up
out of either other logical devices, or physical devices. inxi does its
best to show what each logical device is made out of. RAID devices form
a subset of all possible Logical devices, but have their own section,
<strong>-R</strong>.</p>
<p>If <strong>-R</strong> is used with <strong>-Lxx</strong>,
<strong>-Lxx</strong> will not show RAID information for LVM RAID
devices since it's redundant. If <strong>-R</strong> is not used, a
simple RAID line will appear for LVM RAID in <strong>-Lxx</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>-Lxx</strong> also shows all components and devices. Note
that since components can go in many levels, each level per primary
component is indicated by either another 'c', or ends with a 'p' device,
the physical device. The number of c's or p's indicates the depth, so
you can see which component belongs to which.</p>
<p><strong>-L</strong> shows only the top level components/devices (like
<strong>-R</strong>). <strong>-La</strong> shows component/device size,
maj:min ID, mapped name (if applicable), and puts each component/device
on its own line.</p>
<p>Sample:</p>
<pre><code>  Device-10: mybackup type: LUKS dm: dm-28 size: 6.36 GiB Components: 
    c-1: md1 cc-1: dm-26 ppp-1: sdj2 cc-2: dm-27 ppp-1: sdk2
  LV-5: lvm_raid1 type: raid1 dm: dm-16 size: 4.88 GiB 
    RAID: stripes: 2 sync: idle copied: 100% mismatches: 0 
  Components: c-1: dm-10 pp-1: sdd1 c-2: dm-11 pp-1: sdd1 c-3: dm-13 
    pp-1: sde1 c-4: dm-15 pp-1: sde1</code></pre>
<p>It is easier to follow the flow of components and devices using
<strong>-y1</strong>. In this example, there is one primary component
(c-1), md1, which is made up of two components (cc-1,2), dm-26 and
dm-27. These are respectively made from physical devices (p-1) sdj2 and
sdk2.</p>
<pre><code>Device-10: mybackup
  maj-min: 254:28
  type: LUKS
  dm: dm-28
  size: 6.36 GiB
  Components: 
    c-1: md1
    maj-min: 9:1
    size: 6.37 GiB
    cc-1: dm-26
      maj-min: 254:26
      mapped: vg5-level1a
      size: 12.28 GiB
      ppp-1: sdj2
        maj-min: 8:146
        size: 12.79 GiB
    cc-2: dm-27
      maj-min: 254:27
      mapped: vg5-level1b
      size: 6.38 GiB
      ppp-1: sdk2
        maj-min: 8:162
        size: 12.79 GiB</code></pre>
<p>Other types of logical block handling like LUKS, bcache show as:</p>
<p><strong>Device-[xx] [name/id] type:
[LUKS|Crypto|bcache]:</strong></p>
<p><strong>-m , <strong>--memory</strong></strong><br />
Memory (RAM) data. Does not display with <strong>-b</strong> or
<strong>-F</strong> unless you use <strong>-m</strong> explicitly.
Ordered by system board physical system memory array(s)
(<strong>Array-[number]</strong>), and individual memory devices
(<strong>Device-[number]</strong>). Physical memory array data shows
array capacity, number of devices supported, and Error Correction
information. Devices shows locator data (highly variable in syntax),
size, speed, type (eg: <strong>type: DDR3</strong>).</p>
<p>Note: <strong>-m</strong> uses <strong>dmidecode</strong>, which must
be run as root (or start <strong>inxi</strong> with
<strong>doas/sudo</strong>), unless you figure out how to set up
doas/sudo to permit dmidecode to read <strong>/dev/mem</strong> as user.
<strong>speed</strong> and <strong>bus-width</strong> will not show if
<strong>No Module Installed</strong> is found in
<strong>size</strong>.</p>
<p>Note: If <strong>-m</strong> is triggered RAM total/used report will
appear in this section, not in <strong>-I</strong> or
<strong>-tm</strong> items.</p>
<p>Because <strong>dmidecode</strong> data is extremely unreliable, inxi
will try to make best guesses. If you see <strong>(check)</strong> after
the capacity number, you should check it with the specifications.
<strong>(est)</strong> is slightly more reliable, but you should still
check the real specifications before buying RAM. Unfortunately there is
nothing <strong>inxi</strong> can do to get truly reliable data about
the system RAM; maybe one day the kernel devs will put this data into
<strong>/sys</strong>, and make it real data, taken from the actual
system, not dmi data. For most people, the data will be right, but a
significant percentage of users will have either a wrong max module
size, if present, or max capacity.</p>
<p>Under dmidecode, <strong>Speed:</strong> is the expected speed of the
memory (what is advertised on the memory spec sheet) and
<strong>Configured Clock Speed:</strong> is what the actual speed is
now. To handle this, if speed and configured speed values are different,
you will see this instead:</p>
<p><strong>speed: spec: [specified speed] MT/S actual: [actual]
MT/S</strong></p>
<p>Also, if DDR, and speed in MHz, will change to: **speed: [speed] MT/S
** ([speed] MHz)</p>
<p>If the detected speed is logically absurd, like 1 MT/s or 69910 MT/s,
adds: <strong>note: check</strong>. Sample:</p>
<pre><code>Memory:
  RAM: total: 31.38 GiB used: 20.65 GiB (65.8%) 
  Array-1: capacity: N/A slots: 4 note: check EC: N/A 
  Device-1: DIMM_A1 size: 8 GiB speed: 1600 MT/s (800 MHz) 
  Device-2: DIMM_A2 size: 8 GiB speed: spec: 1600 MT/s (800 MHz) 
    actual: 61910 MT/s (30955 MHz) note: check 
  Device-3: DIMM_B1 size: 8 GiB speed: 1600 MT/s (800 MHz) 
  Device-4: DIMM_B2 size: 8 GiB speed: spec: 1600 MT/s (800 MHz) 
    actual: 2 MT/s (1 MHz) note: check</code></pre>
<p>See <strong>--memory-modules</strong> and
<strong>--memory-short</strong> if you want a shorter report.</p>
<p><strong>--memory-modules</strong><br />
Memory (RAM) data. Show only RAM arrays and modules in Memory report.
Skip empty slots. See <strong>-m</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>--memory-short</strong><br />
Memory (RAM) data. Show a one line RAM report in Memory. See
<strong>-m</strong>.</p>
<p>Sample: <strong>Report: arrays: 1 slots: 4 modules: 2 type:
DDR4</strong></p>
<p><strong>-M , <strong>--machine</strong></strong><br />
Show machine data. Device, Motherboard, BIOS, and if present, System
Builder (Like Lenovo). Older systems/kernels without the required
<strong>/sys</strong> data can use <strong>dmidecode</strong> instead,
run as root. If using <strong>dmidecode</strong>, may also show
BIOS/UEFI revision as well as version. <strong>--dmidecode</strong>
forces use of <strong>dmidecode</strong> data instead of
<strong>/sys</strong>. Will also attempt to show if the system was
booted by BIOS, UEFI, or UEFI [Legacy], the latter being legacy BIOS
boot mode in a system board using UEFI.</p>
<p>Device information requires either <strong>/sys</strong> or
<strong>dmidecode</strong>. Note that <strong>other-vm?</strong> is a
type that means it's usually a VM, but inxi failed to detect which type,
or positively confirm which VM it is. Primary VM identification is via
systemd-detect-virt but fallback tests that should also support some
BSDs are used. Less commonly used or harder to detect VMs may not be
correctly detected. If you get an incorrect output, post an issue and
we'll get it fixed if possible.</p>
<p>Due to unreliable vendor data, device type will show: desktop,
laptop, notebook, server, blade, plus some obscure stuff that inxi is
unlikely to ever run on.</p>
<p><strong>-n , <strong>--network-advanced</strong></strong><br />
Show Advanced Network device information in addition to that produced by
<strong>-N</strong>. Shows interface, speed, MAC ID, state, etc.</p>
<p><strong>-N , <strong>--network</strong></strong><br />
Show Network device(s) information, including device driver. With
<strong>-x</strong>, shows Bus ID, Port number.</p>
<p><strong>-o , <strong>--unmounted</strong></strong><br />
Show unmounted partition information (includes UUID and LABEL if
available). Shows file system type if you have <strong>lsblk</strong>
installed (Linux only). For BSD/GNU Linux: shows file system type if
<strong>file</strong> is installed, and if you are root or if you have
added to <strong>/etc/sudoers</strong> (sudo v. 1.7 or newer):</p>
<p><strong>&lt;username&gt; ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/file
(sample)</strong></p>
<p>doas users: see <strong>man doas.conf</strong> for setup.</p>
<p>Does not show components (partitions that create the md-raid array)
of md-raid arrays.</p>
<p>To show partition labels or UUIDs (when available and relevant), use
with <strong>-l</strong> or** -u**.</p>
<p><strong>-p , <strong>--partitions-full</strong></strong><br />
Show full Partition information (<strong>-P</strong> plus all other
detected mounted partitions).</p>
<p>To show partition labels or UUIDs (when available and relevant), use
with <strong>-l</strong> or** -u**.</p>
<p><strong>-P , <strong>--partitions</strong></strong><br />
Show basic Partition information. Shows, if detected: **/ /boot
/boot/efi /home /opt /tmp /usr /usr/home /var ** /var/tmp /var/log (for
android, shows <strong>/cache /data /firmware /system</strong>). If
<strong>--swap</strong> is not used, shows active swap partitions (never
shows file or zram type swap). Use <strong>-p</strong> to see all
mounted partitions.</p>
<p>To show partition labels or UUIDs (when available and relevant), use
with <strong>-l</strong> or** -u**.</p>
<p><strong>--processes</strong></p>
<p>See <strong>-t</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>-r , <strong>--repos</strong></strong><br />
Show distro repository data. Currently supported repo types:</p>
<p><strong>APK</strong> (Alpine Linux + derived versions)</p>
<p><strong>APT</strong> (Debian, Ubuntu + derived versions, as well as
RPM based APT distros like PCLinuxOS or Alt-Linux)</p>

<p>See <strong>-rx</strong>, <strong>-rxx</strong>, and
<strong>-ra</strong> for installed package count information.</p>
<p><strong>-R , <strong>--raid</strong></strong><br />
Show RAID data. Shows RAID devices, states, levels, device/array size,
and components. See extra data with <strong>-x</strong> /
<strong>-xx</strong>.</p>
<p>md-raid: If device is resyncing, also shows resync progress line.</p>
<p>Note: supported types: lvm raid, md-raid, softraid, ZFS, and hardware
RAID. Other software RAID types may be added, if the software RAID can
be made to give the required output.</p>
<p>The component ID numbers work like this: mdraid: the numerator is the
actual mdraid component number; lvm/softraid/ZFS: the numerator is
auto-incremented counter only. Eg. <strong>Online: 1: sdb1</strong></p>
<p>If hardware RAID is detected, shows basic information. Due to
complexity of adding hardware RAID device disk / RAID reports, those
will only be added if there is demand, and reasonable reporting
tools.</p>
<p><strong>--recommends</strong><br />
Checks inxi application dependencies and recommends, as well as
directories, then shows what package(s) you need to install to add
support for each feature.</p>
<p><strong>-s , <strong>--sensors</strong></strong><br />
Show output from sensors if sensors installed/configured:
Motherboard/CPU/GPU temperatures; detected fan speeds. GPU temperature
when available. Nvidia shows screen number for multiple screens. IPMI
sensors are also used (root required) if present. See Advanced options
<strong>--sensors-use</strong> or <strong>--sensors-exclude</strong> if
you want to use only a subset of all sensors, or exclude one.</p>
<p><strong>--slots</strong><br />
Show PCI slots with type, speed, and status information.</p>
<p><strong>--swap</strong></p>
<p>See <strong>-j</strong></p>
<p><strong>-S , <strong>--system</strong></strong><br />
Show System information: host name, kernel, desktop environment (if in
X), distro. With <strong>-xx</strong> show dm - or startx - (only shows
if present and running if out of X), and if in X, with
<strong>-xxx</strong> show more desktop info, e.g. taskbar or panel.</p>
<p><strong>-t , <strong>--processes</strong></strong><br />
[<strong>c</strong>|<strong>m</strong>|<strong>cm</strong>|<strong>mc
NUMBER</strong>] Show processes. If no arguments, defaults to
<strong>cm</strong>. If followed by a number, shows that number of
processes for each type (default: <strong>5</strong>; if in IRC, max:
<strong>5</strong>)</p>
<p>Make sure that there is no space between letters and numbers (e.g.
write as <strong>-t cm10</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>-t c</strong><br />
- CPU only. With <strong>-x</strong>, also shows memory for that process
on same line.</p>
<p><strong>-t m</strong><br />
- memory only. With <strong>-x</strong>, also shows CPU for that process
on same line. If the <strong>-I</strong> or <strong>-m</strong> lines
are not triggered, will also show the system RAM used/total
information.</p>
<p><strong>-t cm</strong><br />
- CPU+memory. With <strong>-x</strong>, shows also CPU or memory for
that process on same line.</p>
<p><strong>-u , <strong>--uuid</strong></strong><br />
Show partition UUIDs. Use with <strong>-j</strong>, <strong>-o</strong>,
<strong>-p</strong>, and <strong>-P</strong> to show partition labels.
Does nothing without one of those options.</p>
<p>Sample: <strong>-opju</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>-U , <strong>--update</strong></strong><br />
Note - Maintainer may have disabled this function.</p>
<p>If inxi <strong>-h</strong> has no listing for <strong>-U</strong>
then it's disabled.</p>
<p>Auto-update script. Note: if you installed as root, you must be root
to update, otherwise user is fine. Also installs / updates this man page
to: <strong>/usr/local/share/man/man1</strong> (if
<strong>/usr/local/share/man/</strong> exists AND there is no inxi man
page in <strong>/usr/share/man/man1</strong>, otherwise it goes to
<strong>/usr/share/man/man1</strong>). This requires that you be root to
write to that directory. See <strong>--man</strong> or
<strong>--no-man</strong> to force or disable man install.</p>
<p><strong>--usb</strong></p>
<p>See <strong>-J</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>-V, <strong>--version</strong></strong><br />
inxi version information. Prints information then exits.</p>
<p><strong>-v , <strong>--verbosity</strong></strong><br />
Script verbosity levels. If no verbosity level number is given, 0 is
assumed. Should not be used with <strong>-b</strong> or
<strong>-F</strong>.</p>
<p>Supported levels: <strong>0-8</strong> Examples :** inxi -v 4 ** or
** inxi -v4**</p>
<p><strong>-v 0</strong><br />

- Adds networking device (<strong>-N</strong>), Machine
(<strong>-M</strong>) data, Battery (<strong>-B</strong>) (if
available). Same as: <strong>inxi -b</strong></p>
<p><strong>-v 3</strong><br />
- Adds advanced CPU (<strong>-C</strong>) and network
(<strong>-n</strong>) data; triggers <strong>-x</strong> advanced data
option.</p>
<p><strong>-v 4</strong><br />
- Adds partition size/used data (<strong>-P</strong>) for (if present):
<strong>/ /home /var/ ** /boot. Shows full disk data (</strong>-D**)</p>
<p><strong>-v 5</strong><br />
- Adds audio device (<strong>-A</strong>), memory/RAM
(<strong>-m</strong>), bluetooth data (<strong>-E</strong>) (if
present), sensors (<strong>-s</strong>), RAID data (if present),
partition label (<strong>-l</strong>), UUID (<strong>-u</strong>), full
swap data (<strong>-j</strong>), and short form of optical drives.</p>
<p><strong>-v 6</strong><br />

- All system data available. Adds Repos (<strong>-r</strong>), PCI slots
(<strong>--slots</strong>), processes (<strong>-tcm</strong>), admin
(<strong>--admin</strong>). Useful for testing output and to see what
data you can get from your system.</p>
<p><strong>-w , <strong>--weather</strong></strong><br />
Adds weather line. To get weather for an alternate location, use **-W **
[location]. See also <strong>-x</strong>, <strong>-xx</strong>,
<strong>-xxx</strong> options. Please note that your distribution's
maintainer may chose to disable this feature.</p>
<p>DO NOT USE THIS FEATURE FOR AUTOMATED WEATHER UPDATES! Automated or
excessive use will lead to your being blocked from any further access.
This feature is not meant for widget type weather monitoring, or Conky
type use. It is meant to get weather when you need to see it, for
example, on a remote server. If you did not type the weather option in
manually, it's an automated request.</p>
<p><strong>-W, <strong>--weather-location</strong>
&lt;location_string&gt;</strong><br />
Get weather/time for an alternate location. Accepts postal/zip code[,
country], city,state pair, or latitude,longitude. Note:
city/country/state names must not contain spaces. Replace spaces with
'<strong>+</strong>' sign. Don't place spaces around any commas. Postal
code is not reliable except for North America and maybe the UK. Try
postal codes with and without country code added. Note that City,State
applies only to USA, otherwise it's City,Country. If country name
(english) does not work, try 2 character country code (e.g. Spain: es;
Great Britain: gb).</p>
<p>See <em><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2</a></em>
for current 2 letter country codes.</p>
<p>Use only ASCII letters in city/state/country names.</p>
<p>Examples: <strong>-W 95623,us</strong> OR <strong>-W
Boston,MA</strong> OR <strong>-W 45.5234,-122.6762</strong> OR
<strong>-W new+york,ny</strong> OR <strong>-W bodo,norway</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>--weather-source, <strong>--ws</strong>
&lt;unit&gt;</strong><br />
[<strong>1-9</strong>] Switches weather data source. Possible values are
<strong>1-9</strong>. <strong>1-4</strong> will generally be active, and
<strong>5-9</strong> may or may not be active, so check.
<strong>1</strong> may not support city / country names with spaces
(even if you use the <strong>+</strong> sign instead of space).
<strong>2</strong> offers pretty good data, but may not have all small
city names for <strong>-W</strong>.</p>
<p>Please note that the data sources are not static per value, and can
change any time, or be removed, so always test to verify which source is
being used for each value if that is important to you. Data sources may
be added or removed on occasions, so try each one and see which you
prefer. If you get unsupported source message, it means that number has
not been implemented.</p>
<p><strong>--weather-unit &lt;unit&gt;</strong><br />
[<strong>m</strong>|<strong>i</strong>|<strong>mi</strong>|<strong>im</strong>]
Sets weather units to metric (<strong>m</strong>), imperial
(<strong>i</strong>), metric (imperial) (<strong>mi</strong>, default),
imperial (metric) (<strong>im</strong>). If metric or imperial not
found,sets to default value, or <strong>N/A</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="filter-options">Filter options</h2>
<p>The following options allow for applying various types of filtering
to the output.</p>
<p><strong>--filter , <strong>--filter-override</strong></strong></p>
<p>See <strong>-z</strong>, <strong>-Z</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>--filter-label, <strong>--filter-uuid</strong>,
<strong>--filter-vulnerabilities</strong></strong></p>
<p>See <strong>--zl</strong>, <strong>--zu</strong>,
<strong>--zv</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>--host</strong><br />
Turns on hostname in System line. Overrides inxi config file value (if
set):</p>
<p><strong>SHOW_HOST='false'</strong> - Same as:
<strong>SHOW_HOST='true'</strong></p>
<p>This is an absolute override, the host will always show no matter
what other switches you use.</p>
<p><strong>--no-host</strong><br />
Turns off hostname in System line. This is default when using
<strong>-z</strong>, for anonymizing inxi output for posting on forums
or IRC. Overrides configuration value (if set):</p>
<p><strong>SHOW_HOST='true'</strong> - Same as:
<strong>SHOW_HOST='false'</strong></p>
<p>This is an absolute override, the host will not show no matter what
other switches you use.</p>
<p><strong>-z, <strong>--filter</strong></strong><br />
Adds security filters for IP addresses, serial numbers, MAC, location
(<strong>-w</strong>), and user home directory name. Removes Host:. On
by default for IRC clients.</p>
<p><strong>--zl, <strong>--filter-label</strong></strong><br />
Filter partition label names from <strong>-j</strong>,
<strong>-o</strong>, <strong>-p</strong>, <strong>-P</strong>, and
<strong>-Sa</strong> (root=LABEL=...). Generally only useful in very
specialized cases.</p>
<p><strong>--zu, <strong>--filter-uuid</strong></strong><br />
Filter partition UUIDs from <strong>-j</strong>, <strong>-o</strong>,
<strong>-p</strong>, <strong>-P</strong>, and <strong>-Sa</strong>
(root=UUID=...). Generally only useful in very specialized cases.</p>
<p><strong>--zv, <strong>--filter-v</strong>,
<strong>--filter-vulnerabilities</strong></strong><br />
Filter Vulnerabilities report from <strong>-Ca</strong>. Generally only
useful in very specialized cases.</p>
<p><strong>-Z , <strong>--filter-override</strong> ,
<strong>--no-filter</strong></strong><br />
Absolute override for output filters. Useful for debugging networking
issues in IRC for example.</p>
<h2 id="output-control-options">Output control options</h2>
<p>The following options allow for modifying the output in various
ways.</p>
<p><strong>-c , <strong>--color</strong>
[<strong>0</strong>-<strong>42</strong>]</strong><br />
Set color scheme. If no scheme number is supplied, 0 is assumed.</p>
<p><strong>-c [<strong>94</strong>-<strong>99</strong>]</strong><br />
These color selectors run a color selector option prior to inxi starting
which lets you set the config file value for the selection.</p>
<p>NOTE: All configuration file set color values are removed when output
is piped or redirected. You must use the explicit runtime <strong>-c
&lt;color number&gt;</strong> option if you want color codes to be
present in the piped/redirected output.</p>
<p>Color selectors for each type display (NOTE: IRC and global only show
safe color set):</p>
<p><strong>-c 94</strong><br />
- Console, out of X.</p>
<p><strong>-c 95</strong><br />
- Terminal, running in X - like xTerm.</p>
<p><strong>-c 96</strong><br />
- GUI IRC, running in X - like XChat, Quassel, Konversation etc.</p>
<p><strong>-c 97</strong><br />
- Console IRC running in X - like irssi in xTerm.</p>
<p><strong>-c 98</strong><br />
- Console IRC not in X.</p>
<p><strong>-c 99</strong><br />
- Global - Overrides/removes all settings.</p>
<p>Setting a specific color type removes the global color selection.</p>
<p><strong>--indent [11-xx]</strong><br />
Change primary wide indent width. Generally useless. Only applied if
output width is greater than max wrap width (see
<strong>--max-wrap</strong>). Use configuration item
<strong>INDENT</strong> to make permanent.</p>
<p><strong>--indents [0-10]</strong><br />
Change primary wrap mode, second, and <strong>-y1</strong> level
indents. First indent level only applied if output width is less than
max wrap width (see <strong>--max-wrap</strong>). 0 disables all wrapped
indents and all second level indents. Use configuration item
<strong>INDENTS</strong> to make permanent.</p>
<p><strong>--limit [-1 - x]</strong><br />
Raise or lower max output limit of IP addresses for <strong>-i</strong>.
<strong>-1</strong> removes limit.</p>
<p><strong>--max-wrap, <strong>--wrap-max</strong>
[integer]</strong><br />
Overrides default or configuration set line starter wrap width value.
Wrap max is the maximum width that inxi will wrap line starters (e.g.
<strong>Info:</strong>) to their own lines, with data lines indented
default 2 columns (use <strong>--indents</strong> to change).</p>
<p>If terminal/console width or <strong>--width</strong> is less than
wrap width, wrapping of line starter occurs. If <strong>80</strong> or
less, no wrapping will occur. Overrides internal default value (110) and
user configuration value <strong>MAX_WRAP</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>--output [json|screen|xml]</strong><br />
Change data output type. Requires --output-file if not
<strong>screen</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>--output-file [full path to output file|print]</strong><br />
The given directory path must exist. The directory path given must
exist, The <strong>print</strong> options prints to stdout. Required for
non-screen <strong>--output</strong> formats (json|xml).</p>
<p><strong>--partition-sort
[dev-base|fs|id|label|percent-used|size|uuid|used]</strong><br />
Change default sort order of partition output. Corresponds to
<strong>PARTITION_SORT</strong> configuration item. These are the
available sort options:</p>
<p><strong>dev-base</strong> - <strong>/dev</strong> partition
identifier, like <strong>/dev/sda1</strong>. Note that it's an
alphabetic sort, so <strong>sda12</strong> is before
<strong>sda2</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>fs</strong> - Partition filesystem. Note that sorts will be
somewhat random if all filesystems are the same.</p>
<p><strong>id</strong> - Mount point of partition (default).</p>
<p><strong>label</strong> - Label of partition. If partitions have no
labels, sort will be random.</p>
<p><strong>percent-used</strong> - Percentage of partition size
used.</p>
<p><strong>size</strong> - KiB size of partition.</p>
<p><strong>uuid</strong> - UUID of the partition.</p>
<p><strong>used</strong> - KiB used of partition.</p>
<p><strong>--wrap-max [integer]</strong></p>
<p>See <strong>--max-wrap</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>-y, <strong>--width</strong> [integer]</strong><br />
This is an absolute width override which sets the output line width max.
Overrides <strong>COLS_MAX_IRC</strong>,
<strong>COLS_MAX_NO_DISPLAY</strong>, <strong>COLS_MAX_CONSOLE</strong>
configuration items, or the actual widths of the terminal.</p>
<p>* <strong>-y</strong> - sets default width of 80 columns.<br />
* <strong>-y [80-xxx]</strong> - sets width to given number. Must be 80
or more.<br />
* <strong>-y 1</strong> - switches to a single indented key/value pair
per line, and removes all long line wrapping (similar to
<strong>dmidecode</strong> output). Not recommended for use with
<strong>-Y</strong>;<br />
* <strong>-y -1</strong> - removes width limits (if assigned by
configuration items).</p>
<p>Examples:<br />
<strong>inxi -Fxx -y 130</strong><br />
<strong>inxi -Fxxy</strong><br />
<strong>inxi -bay1</strong></p>
<p><strong>-Y, <strong>--height</strong>, <strong>--less</strong>
[-3-[integer]</strong><br />
Control output height. Useful when in console, and scrollback not
available. Breaks output flow based on values provided.</p>
<p>* <strong>-Y 0</strong> or <strong>-Y</strong> - Set default max
height to terminal height.<br />
* <strong>-Y [1-xxx]</strong> - set max output block height height in
lines.<br />
* <strong>-Y -1</strong> - Print out one primary data item block (like
<strong>CPU:</strong>, <strong>System:</strong>) at a time. Useful for
very long outputs like <strong>-Fa</strong>, <strong>-v8</strong>, etc.
Not available for <strong>-h</strong>.<br />
* <strong>-Y -2</strong> - Do not disable output colors when redirected
or piped to another program. Useful if piping output to <strong>less
-R</strong> for example. This does not limit the height otherwise since
the expectation it is being piped to another program like
<strong>less</strong> which will handle that.<br />
* <strong>-Y -3</strong> - Restore default unlimited output lines if
<strong>LINES_MAX</strong> configuration item set.</p>
<p>Recommended to use the following for very clean up and down
scrollable output out of display, while retaining the color schemes,
which are normally removed with piping or redirect:</p>
<p><strong>pinxi -v8Y -2 | less -R</strong></p>
<p>Note: since it's not possible for inxi to know how many actual
terminal lines are being used by terminal wrapped output, with
<strong>-y 1</strong> , it may be better in general to use a fixed
height like:</p>
<p><strong>-y 1 -Y 20</strong> instead of: <strong>-y 1 -Y</strong></p>
<h2 id="extra-data-options">Extra data options</h2>
<p>These options can be triggered by one or more <strong>-x</strong>.
Alternatively, the <strong>-v</strong> options trigger them in the
following way: <strong>-v 3</strong> adds <strong>-x</strong>;
<strong>-v 6</strong> adds <strong>-xx</strong>; <strong>-v 7</strong>
adds <strong>-xxx</strong></p>
<p>These extra data triggers can be useful for getting more in-depth
data on various options. They can be added to any long form option list,
e.g.: <strong>-bxx</strong> or <strong>-Sxxx</strong></p>
<p>There are 3 extra data levels:<br />
<strong>-x</strong>, <strong>-xx</strong>, <strong>-xxx</strong><br />
OR<br />
<strong>--extra 1</strong>, <strong>--extra 2</strong>, <strong>--extra
3</strong></p>
<p>The following details show which lines / items display extra
information for each extra data level.</p>
<p><strong>-x -A</strong><br />
- Adds (if available and/or relevant) <strong>vendor:</strong> item,
which shows specific vendor [product] information.</p>
<p>- Adds version/port(s)/driver version (if available) for each
device.</p>
<p>- Adds PCI/USB ID of each device.</p>
<p>- Adds non-running sound servers, if detected.</p>
<p><strong>-x -B</strong><br />
- Adds vendor/model, battery status (if battery present).</p>
<p>- Adds attached battery powered peripherals
(<strong>Device-[number]:</strong>) if detected (keyboard, mouse,
etc.).</p>
<p>- Adds battery <strong>volts:</strong>, <strong>min:</strong>
voltages. Note that if difference is critical, that is current voltage
is too close to minimum voltage, shows without <strong>-x</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>-x -C</strong><br />
- Adds bogomips to CPU speed report (if available).</p>
<p>- Adds <strong>L1:</strong> and <strong>L3:</strong> cache types if
either are present/available. For BSD or legacy Linux, uses dmidecode +
doas/sudo/root. Force use of dmidecode cache values by adding
<strong>--dmidecode</strong>. This will override /sys based cache data,
which tends to be better, so in general don't do that.</p>
<p>- Adds <strong>boost: [enabled|disabled]</strong> if detected, aka
<strong>turbo</strong>. Not all CPUs have this feature.</p>
<p>- Adds CPU Flags (short list). Use <strong>-f</strong> to see full
flag/feature list.</p>
<p>- Adds CPU microarchitecture + revision (e.g. Sandy Bridge, K8,
ARMv8, P6, etc.). Only shows data if detected. Newer microarchitectures
will have to be added as they appear, and require the CPU family ID,
model ID, and stepping.</p>
<p>- Adds, if smt (Simultaneous MultiThreading) is available but
disabled, after <strong>type:</strong> data <strong>smt:
disabled</strong>. <strong>type: MT</strong> means it's enabled. See
<strong>-Cxxx</strong>.</p>
<p>Examples:<br />
<strong>arch: Sandy Bridge rev: 2</strong><br />
<strong>arch: K8 rev.F+ rev: 2</strong></p>
<p>If unable to non-ambiguosly determine architecture, will show
something like: <strong>arch: Amber Lake note: check rev: 9</strong></p>
<p>- Adds CPU highest speed after <strong>avg: [speed] high:
[speed]</strong> if greater than 1 core and cores have different speeds.
Linux only.</p>
<p><strong>-x -d</strong><br />
- Adds more items to <strong>Features</strong> line of optical drive;
dds rev version to optical drive.</p>
<p><strong>-x -D</strong><br />
- Adds HDD temperature with disk data.</p>
<p>Method 1: Systems running Linux kernels ~5.6 and newer should have
<strong>drivetemp</strong> module data available. If so, drive temps
will come from /sys data for each drive, and will not require root or
hddtemp. This method is MUCH faster than using hddtemp. Note that NVMe
drives do not require <strong>drivetemp</strong>.</p>
<p>If your <strong>drivetemp</strong> module is not enabled, enable
it:</p>
<p><strong>modprobe drivetemp</strong></p>
<p>Once enabled, add <strong>drivetemp</strong> to
<strong>/etc/modules</strong> or
<strong>/etc/modules-load.d/***.conf</strong> so it starts
automatically.</p>
<p>If you see drive temps running as regular user and you did not
configure system to use doas/sudo hddtemp, then your system supports
this feature. If no /sys data is found, inxi will try to use hddtemp
methods instead for that drive. Hint: if temp is /sys sourced, the temp
will be to 1 decimal, like 34.8, if hddtemp sourced, they will be
integers.</p>
<p>Method 2: if you have hddtemp installed, if you are root or if you
have added to <strong>/etc/sudoers</strong> (sudo v. 1.7 or newer):</p>
<p><strong>&lt;username&gt; ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/hddtemp
(sample)</strong></p>
<p>doas users: see <strong>man doas.conf</strong> for setup.</p>
<p>You can force use of <strong>hddtemp</strong> for all drives using
<strong>--hddtemp</strong>.</p>
<p>- If free LVM volume group size detected (root required), show
<strong>lvm-free:</strong> on Local Storage line. This is how much
unused space the VGs contain, that is, space not assigned to LVs.</p>
<p><strong>-x -E (</strong>--bluetooth**)**<br />
- Adds (if available and/or relevant) <strong>vendor:</strong> item,
which shows specific vendor [product] information.</p>
<p>- Adds PCI/USB Bus ID of each device.</p>
<p>- Adds driver version (if available) for each device.</p>
<p>- Adds (if available, and <strong>hciconfig</strong> only) LMP (HCI
if no LMP data, and HCI if HCI/LMP versions are different) version (if
available) for each HCI ID.</p>
<p><strong>-x -G</strong><br />
- Adds PCI/USB ID of each device.</p>
<p>- Adds (if available and/or relevant) <strong>vendor:</strong> item,
which shows specific vendor [product] information.</p>
<p>- <strong>X.org:</strong> Adds direct rendering status.</p>
<p>- <strong>X.org:</strong> Adds (for single GPU, nvidia driver) screen
number that GPU is running on.</p>
<p><strong>-x -i</strong><br />
- Adds IP v6 additional scope data, like Global, Site, Temporary for
each interface.</p>
<p>Note that there is no way we are aware of to filter out the
deprecated IP v6 scope site/global temporary addresses from the output
of <strong>ifconfig</strong>. The <strong>ip</strong> tool shows that
clearly.</p>
<p><strong>ip-v6-temporary</strong> - (<strong>ip</strong> tool only),
scope global temporary. Scope global temporary deprecated is not
shown</p>
<p><strong>ip-v6-global</strong> - scope global
(<strong>ifconfig</strong> will show this for all types, global, global
temporary, and global temporary deprecated, <strong>ip</strong> shows it
only for global)</p>
<p><strong>ip-v6-link</strong> - scope link
(<strong>ip</strong>/<strong>ifconfig</strong>) - default for
<strong>-i</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>ip-v6-site</strong> - scope site
(<strong>ip</strong>/<strong>ifconfig</strong>). This has been
deprecated in IPv6, but still exists. <strong>ifconfig</strong> may show
multiple site values, as with global temporary, and global temporary
deprecated.</p>
<p><strong>ip-v6-unknown</strong> - unknown scope</p>
<p><strong>-x -I</strong><br />
- Adds current init system (and init rc in some cases, like OpenRC).
With <strong>-xx</strong>, shows init/rc version number, if
available.</p>
<p>- Adds default system gcc. With <strong>-xx</strong>, also show other
installed gcc versions.</p>
<p>- Adds current runlevel (not available with all init systems).</p>
<p>- Adds total packages discovered in system. See <strong>-xx</strong>
and <strong>-a</strong> for per package manager types output. Moves to
<strong>Repos</strong> if <strong>-rx</strong>.</p>
<p>If your package manager is not supported, please file an issue and
we'll add it. That requires the full output of the query or method to
discover all installed packages on your system, as well of course as the
command or method used to discover those.</p>
<p>- If in shell (i.e. not in IRC client), adds shell version number, if
available.</p>
<p><strong>-x -j, <strong>-x</strong> --swap</strong><br />
Add <strong>mapper:</strong>. See <strong>-x -o</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>-x -J (</strong>--usb**)**<br />
- For Devices, adds driver(s).</p>
<p><strong>-x -L, <strong>-x</strong> --logical</strong><br />
- Adds <strong>dm: dm-x</strong> to VG &gt; LV and other Device types.
This can help tracking down which device belongs to what.</p>
<p><strong>-x -m, <strong>--memory-modules</strong></strong><br />
- If present, adds maximum memory module/device size in the Array line.
Only some systems will have this data available. Shows estimate if it
can generate one.</p>
<p>- Adds device type in the Device line.</p>
<p><strong>-x -N</strong><br />
- Adds (if available and/or relevant) <strong>vendor:</strong> item,
which shows specific vendor [product] information.</p>
<p>- Adds version/port(s)/driver version (if available) for each
device;</p>
<p>- Adds PCI/USB ID of each device.</p>
<p><strong>-x -o, <strong>-x</strong> -p, <strong>-x</strong>
-P</strong><br />
- Adds <strong>mapper:</strong> (the <strong>/dev/mapper/</strong>
partition ID) if mapped partition.</p>
<p>Example: <strong>ID-4: /home ... dev: /dev/dm-6 mapped:
ar0-home</strong></p>
<p><strong>-x -r</strong><br />
- Adds Package info. See <strong>-Ix</strong></p>
<p><strong>-x -R</strong><br />
- md-raid: Adds second RAID Info line with extra data: blocks, chunk
size, bitmap (if present). Resync line, shows blocks synced/total
blocks.</p>
<p>- Hardware RAID: Adds driver version, Bus ID.</p>
<p><strong>-x -s</strong><br />
- Adds basic voltages: 12v, 5v, 3.3v, vbat (<strong>ipmi</strong>,
<strong>lm-sensors</strong> if present).</p>
<p><strong>-x -S</strong><br />
- Adds Kernel gcc version.</p>
<p>- Adds to <strong>Distro:</strong> <strong>base:</strong> if
detected. System base will only be seen on a subset of distributions.
The distro must be both derived from a parent distro (e.g. Mint from
Ubuntu), and explicitly added to the supported distributions for this
feature. Due to the complexity of distribution identification, these
will only be added as relatively solid methods are found for each
distribution system base detection.</p>
<p><strong>-x -t (</strong>--processes**)**<br />
- Adds memory use output to CPU (<strong>-xt c</strong>), and CPU use to
memory (<strong>-xt m</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>-x -w , <strong>-W</strong></strong><br />
- Adds humidity and barometric pressure.</p>
<p>- Adds wind speed and direction.</p>
<p><strong>-xx -A</strong><br />
- Adds vendor:product ID for each device.</p>
<p>- Adds PCIe speed and lanes item (Linux only, if detected).</p>
<p><strong>-xx -B</strong><br />
- Adds serial number.</p>
<p><strong>-xx -D</strong><br />
- Adds disk serial number.</p>
<p>- Adds disk speed (if available). This is the theoretical top speed
of the device as reported. This speed may be restricted by system board
limits, eg. a SATA 3 drive on a SATA 2 board may report SATA 2 speeds,
but this is not completely consistent, sometimes a SATA 3 device on a
SATA 2 board reports its design speed.</p>
<p>NVMe drives: adds lanes, and (per direction) speed is calculated with
lane speed * lanes * PCIe overhead. PCIe 1 and 2 have data rates of GT/s
* .8 = Gb/s (10 bits required to transfer 8 bits of data). PCIe 3 and
greater transfer data at a rate of GT/s * 128/130 * lanes = Gb/s (130
bits required to transfer 128 bits of data).</p>
<p>For a PCIe 3 NVMe drive, with speed of <strong>8 GT/s</strong> and
<strong>4</strong> lanes (<strong>8GT/s * 128/130 * 4 = 31.6
Gb/s</strong>):</p>
<p><strong>speed: 31.6 Gb/s lanes: 4</strong></p>
<p>- Adds disk duid, if available. Some BSDs have it.</p>
<p><strong>-xx -E (</strong>--bluetooth**)**<br />
- Adds vendor:product ID of each device.</p>
<p>- Adds (**hciconfig **only) LMP subversion (and/or HCI revision if
applicable) for each device.</p>
<p>- Adds PCIe speed and lanes item (Linux only, and if PCIe bluetooth,
which is rare).</p>
<p><strong>-xx -G</strong><br />
Triggers much more complete Screen/Monitor output.</p>
<p><strong>X.org:</strong> requires <strong>xdpyinfo</strong> or
<strong>xrandr</strong>, and the advanced per monitor feature requires
<strong>xrandr</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Wayland:</strong> requires any tool capable of showing
monitor and resolution information. <strong>Sway</strong> has
<strong>swaymsg</strong>, <strong>weston-info</strong> or
<strong>wayland-info</strong> can show Wayland information on any
Wayland compositor, and <strong>wlr-randr</strong> can show Wayland
information for any <strong>wlroots</strong> based compositor.</p>
<p>Further note that all references to <strong>Displays</strong>,
<strong>Screens</strong>, and <strong>Monitors</strong> are referring to
the <strong>X</strong> or <strong>Wayland</strong> technical terms, not
normal consumer usage.</p>
<p><strong>X.org:</strong> 1 <strong>Display</strong> runs 1 or more
<strong>Screens</strong>, and 1 <strong>Screen</strong> runs 1 or more
<strong>Monitors</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Wayland:</strong> The <strong>Display</strong> is the primary
container, and it can contain 1 or more <strong>Monitors</strong>.</p>
<p>- Adds vendor:product ID of each device.</p>
<p>- Adds PCIe speed and lanes item (Linux only, and if PCIe device and
detected).</p>
<p>- Adds output port IDs, active, off (connected but disabled, like a
closed laptop lid) and empty. Example:</p>
<p><strong>ports: active: DVI-I-1,VGA-1 empty: HDMI-A-1</strong></p>
<p>- Adds <strong>Display</strong> ID. X.org: the Display running the
Screen that runs the Monitors; Wayland: the Display that runs the
monitors.</p>
<p>- Adds compositor, if found (always shows for Wayland).</p>
<p>- <strong>Wayland:</strong> Adds to <strong>Display</strong>
<strong>d-rect:</strong> if &gt; 1 monitors in Display. This is the size
of the rectangle Wayland creates to situate the monitors in.</p>
<p>- <strong>X.org:</strong> If available, shows
<strong>alternate:</strong> Xorg drivers. This means a driver on the
default list of drivers Xorg automatically checks for the device, but
which is not installed. For example, if you have
<strong>nouveau</strong> driver, <strong>nvidia</strong> would show as
alternate if it was not installed. Note that <strong>alternate:</strong>
does NOT mean you should have it, it's just one of the drivers Xorg
checks to see if is present and loaded when checking the device. This
can let you know there are other driver options. Note that if you have
explicitly set the driver in <strong>xorg.conf</strong>, Xorg will not
create this automatic check driver list.</p>
<p>- <strong>Xorg:</strong> Adds total number of
<strong>Screens</strong> listed for the current
<strong>Display</strong>.</p>
<p>- <strong>Xorg:</strong> Adds default <strong>Screen</strong> ID if
Screen (not monitor!) total is greater than 1.</p>
<p>- <strong>X.org:</strong> Adds <strong>Screen</strong> line, which
includes the ID (<strong>Screen: 0</strong>) then <strong>s-res</strong>
(Screen resolution), <strong>s-dpi</strong>. Remember, this is an Xorg
<strong>Screen</strong>, NOT a monitor screen, and the information
listed is about the Xorg Screen! It may at times be the same as a single
monitor system, but usually it's different in some ways. Note that the
physical monitor dpi and the Xorg dpi are not necessarily the same
thing, and can vary widely.</p>
<p>- Adds <strong>Monitor</strong> lines. Monitors are a subset of a
<strong>Screen</strong> (X.org) or <strong>Display</strong> (Wayland),
each of which can have one or more monitors. Normally a dual monitor
setup is 2 monitors run by one Xorg Screen/Wayland Display.</p>
<p>- <strong>pos: [primary,]{position string|row-col}</strong> (X.org:
requires <strong>xrandr</strong>; Wayland: requires
<strong>swaymsg</strong> [sway], <strong>wlr-randr</strong> [wlroots
based compositors], <strong>weston-info</strong> /
<strong>wayland-info</strong> [all]). Uses either explicit
<strong>primary</strong> value or +0+0 position if no primary monitor
value set. <strong>pos:</strong> does not show for single monitor
setups, or if no position data was found.</p>
<p>Position is text (left, center, center-l, center-r, right, top,
top-left, top-center, top-right, middle, middle-c, middle-r, bottom,
bottom-l, bottom-c, bottom-r) if monitors fit within the following
grids: 1x2, 1x3, 1x4, 2x1, 2x2, 2x3, 3x1, 3x2, 3x3. If layout not
supported in text, uses [row-nu]-[column-nu] instead to indicate the
monitor's position in its grid.</p>
<p>The position is based on the upper left corner of each monitor
relative to the grid of monitors that the <strong>Xorg</strong>
<strong>Screen</strong> is composed of.</p>
<p>- <strong>diag:</strong> monitor screen diagonal in mm (inches). Note
that this is the real monitor size, not the Xorg full Screen diagonal
size, which can be quite different.</p>
<p>- For free drivers, adds OpenGL compatibility version number if
available. For nonfree drivers, the core version and compatibility
versions are usually the same. Example:</p>
<p><strong>v: 3.3 Mesa 11.2.0 compat-v: 3.0</strong></p>
<p><strong>-xx -I</strong><br />
- Adds init type version number (and rc if present).</p>
<p>- Adds other detected installed gcc versions (if present).</p>
<p>- Adds system default runlevel, if detected. Supports
Systemd/Upstart/SysVinit type defaults.</p>
<p>- Shows <strong>Packages:</strong> counts by discovered package
manager types. In cases where only 1 type had results, does not show
total after <strong>Packages:</strong>. Does not show installed package
managers wtih 0 packages. See <strong>-a</strong> for full output. Moves
to <strong>Repos</strong> if <strong>-rxx</strong>.</p>
<p>- Adds parent program (or pty/tty) that started shell, if not IRC
client.</p>
<p><strong>-xx -j (</strong>--swap**), <strong>-xx</strong> -p,
<strong>-xx</strong> -P**<br />

- Adds vendor:chip id.</p>
<p><strong>-xx -L, <strong>-xx</strong> --logical</strong><br />
- Adds internal LVM Logical volumes, like raid image and meta data
volumes.</p>
<p>- Adds full list of Components, sub-components, and their physical
devices.</p>
<p>- For LVM RAID, adds a RAID report line (if not <strong>-R</strong>).
Read up on LVM documentation to better understand their use of the term
'stripes'.</p>
<p><strong>-xx -m, <strong>--memory-modules</strong></strong><br />
- Adds memory device Manufacturer.</p>
<p>- Adds memory device Part Number (<strong>part-no:</strong>). Useful
for ordering new or replacement memory sticks etc. Part numbers are
unique, particularly if you use the word <strong>memory</strong> in the
search as well. With <strong>-xxx</strong>, also shows serial
number.</p>
<p>- Adds single/double bank memory, if data is found. Note, this may
not be 100% right all of the time since it depends on the order that
data is found in <strong>dmidecode</strong> output for <strong>type
6</strong> and <strong>type 17</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>-xx -M</strong><br />
- Adds chassis information, if data is available. Also shows BIOS ROM
size if using <strong>dmidecode</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>-xx -N</strong><br />

- md-raid: Adds superblock (if present) and algorithm. If resync, shows
progress bar.</p>
<p>- Hardware RAID: Adds Chip vendor:product ID.</p>
<p><strong>-xx -s</strong><br />
- Adds DIMM/SOC voltages, if present (<strong>ipmi</strong> only).</p>
<p><strong>-xx -S</strong><br />
- Adds display manager (<strong>dm</strong>) type, if present. If none,
shows N/A. Supports most known display managers, including gdm, gdm3,
idm, kdm, lightdm, lxdm, mdm, nodm, sddm, slim, tint, wdm, and xdm.</p>
<p>- Adds, if run in X, window manager type (<strong>wm</strong>), if
available. Not all window managers are supported. Some desktops support
using more than one window manager, so this can be useful to see what
window manager is actually running. If none found, shows nothing. Uses a
less accurate fallback tool <strong>wmctrl</strong> if
<strong>ps</strong> tests fail to find data.</p>
<p>- Adds desktop toolkit (<strong>tk</strong>), if available
(Xfce/KDE/Trinity).</p>
<p><strong>-xx --slots</strong><br />
- Adds slot length.</p>
<p><strong>-xx -w , <strong>-W</strong></strong><br />
- Adds wind chill, heat index, and dew point, if available.</p>
<p>- Adds cloud cover, rain, snow, or precipitation (amount in previous
hour to observation time), if available.</p>
<p><strong>-xxx -A</strong><br />
- Adds, if present, serial number.</p>
<p>- Adds, if present, PCI/USB class ID.</p>
<p><strong>-xxx -B</strong><br />
- Adds battery chemistry (e.g. <strong>Li-ion</strong>), cycles (NOTE:
there appears to be a problem with the Linux kernel obtaining the cycle
count, so this almost always shows <strong>0</strong>. There's nothing
that can be done about this glitch, the data is simply not available as
of 2018-04-03), location (only available from <strong>dmidecode</strong>
derived output).</p>
<p>- Adds attached device <strong>rechargeable: [yes|no]</strong>
information.</p>
<p><strong>-xxx -C</strong><br />
- Adds CPU voltage and external clock speed (this is the motherboard
speed). Requires doas/sudo/root and <strong>dmidecode</strong>.</p>
<p>- Adds, if smt (Simultaneous MultiThreading) data is available, after
<strong>type:</strong> data <strong>smt: [status]</strong>.<br />
<strong>smt: [status]</strong><br />
<strong>MT</strong> in <strong>type:</strong> will show if smt is
enabled in general. 3 values are possible:
[<strong>enabled|disabled|&lt;unsupported&gt;</strong>].
<strong>&lt;unsupported&gt;</strong> means the CPU does not support
SMT.</p>
<p><strong>-xxx -D</strong><br />
- Adds disk firmware revision number (if available).</p>
<p>- Adds disk partition scheme (in most cases), e.g. <strong>scheme:
GPT</strong>. Currently not able to detect all schemes, but handles the
most common, e.g. <strong>GPT</strong> or <strong>MBR</strong>.</p>
<p>- Adds disk type (<strong>HDD</strong>/<strong>SSD</strong>),
rotation speed (in some but not all cases), e.g. <strong>type: HDD rpm:
7200</strong>, or <strong>type: SSD</strong> if positive SSD
identification was made. If no HDD, rotation, or positive SSD ID found,
shows <strong>type: N/A</strong>. Not all HDD spinning disks report
their speed, so even if they are spinning, no rpm data will show.</p>
<p><strong>-xxx -E (</strong>--bluetooth**)**<br />
- Adds, if present, PCI/USB class ID.</p>
<p>- Adds (**hciconfig **only) HCI version, revision.</p>
<p><strong>-xxx -G</strong><br />
- Adds, if present, Device PCI/USB class ID.</p>
<p>- Adds to Device <strong>serial:</strong> number (if found).</p>
<p>- <strong>Xorg:</strong> Adds to <strong>Screen:</strong>
<strong>s-size:</strong> and <strong>s-diag:</strong>. (Screen size data
requires <strong>xdpyinfo</strong>). This is the X.org Screen
dimensions, NOT the Monitor size!</p>
<p>- Adds to Monitors (if detected) frequency
(<strong>hz:</strong>).</p>
<p>- Adds to Monitors (if detected) size (<strong>size: 277x156mm
(10.9x6.1")</strong>). Note that this is the real physical monitor size,
not the Xorg Screen/Wayland Display size, which can be quite different
(1 Xorg Screen / Wayland Display can for instance contain two or more
monitors).</p>
<p>- Adds to Monitors <strong>modes: min: max:</strong> (if detected).
These are the smallest and largest monitor modes found, using an inexact
method, so might not always be right.</p>
<p>- Adds to Monitors <strong>serial:</strong> number (if detected).</p>
<p>- <strong>Wayland:</strong> Adds to Monitors <strong>scale:</strong>
(if detected).</p>
<p><strong>-xxx -I</strong><br />
- For <strong>Uptime:</strong> adds <strong>wakeups:</strong> to show
how many times the machine has been woken from suspend state during
current uptime period (if available, Linux only). 0 value means the
machine has not been suspended.</p>
<p>- For <strong>Shell:</strong> adds <strong>(su|sudo|login)</strong>
to shell name if present.</p>
<p>- For <strong>Shell:</strong> adds <strong>default:</strong> shell if
different from running shell, and default shell <strong>v:</strong>, if
available.</p>
<p>- For <strong>running-in:</strong> adds <strong>(SSH)</strong> to
parent, if present. SSH detection uses the <strong>whoami</strong>
test.</p>
<p><strong>-xxx -J (</strong>--usb**)**<br />
- Adds, if present, serial number for non hub devices.</p>
<p>- Adds <strong>interfaces:</strong> for non hub devices.</p>
<p>- Adds, if available, USB speed in <strong>Mbits/s</strong> or
<strong>Gbits/s</strong>.</p>
<p>- Adds, if present, USB class ID.</p>
<p>- Adds, if non 0, max power in mA.</p>
<p><strong>-xxx -m, <strong>--memory-modules</strong></strong><br />
- Adds memory bus width: primary bus width, and if present, total width.
e.g. <strong>bus width: 64 bit (total: 72 bits)</strong>. Note that
total / data widths are mixed up sometimes in dmidecode output, so inxi
will take the larger value as the total if present. If no total width
data is found, then inxi will not show that item.</p>
<p>- Adds device Type Detail, e.g. <strong>detail: DDR3
(Synchronous)</strong>.</p>
<p>- Adds, if present, memory module voltage. Only some systems will
have this data available.</p>
<p>- Adds device serial number.</p>
<p><strong>-xxx -N</strong><br />
- Adds, if present, serial number.</p>
<p>- Adds, if present, PCI/USB class ID.</p>
<p><strong>-xxx -R</strong><br />
- md-raid: Adds system mdraid support types (kernel support, read ahead,
RAID events)</p>
<p>- zfs-raid: Adds portion allocated (used) by RAID array/device.</p>
<p>- Hardware RAID: Adds rev, ports, and (if available and/or relevant)
<strong>vendor:</strong> item, which shows specific vendor [product]
information.</p>
<p><strong>-xxx -S</strong><br />
- Adds, if in X, or with <strong>--display</strong>, bar/dock/panel/tray
items (<strong>info</strong>). If none found, shows nothing. Supports
desktop items like gnome-panel, lxpanel, xfce4-panel, lxqt-panel, tint2,
cairo-dock, trayer, and many others.</p>
<p>- Adds (if present), window manager (<strong>wm</strong>) version
number.</p>
<p>- Adds (if present), display manager (<strong>dm</strong>) version
number.</p>
<p>- Adds (if available, and in display), virtual terminal
(<strong>vt</strong>) number. These are the same as
<strong>ctrl+alt+F[x]</strong> numbers usually. Some systems have this,
some don't, it varies.</p>
<p><strong>-xxx -w , <strong>-W</strong></strong><br />
- Adds location (city state country), observation altitude (if
available), weather observation time (if available), sunset/sunrise (if
available).</p>
<h2 id="admin-extra-data-options">Admin extra data options</h2>
<p>These options are triggered with <strong>--admin</strong> or
<strong>-a</strong>. Admin options are advanced output options, and are
more technical, and mostly of interest to system administrators or other
machine admins.</p>
<p>The <strong>--admin</strong> option sets <strong>-xxx</strong>, and
only has to be used once. It will trigger the following features:</p>
<p><strong>-a -A</strong><br />
- Adds, if present, possible <strong>alternate:</strong> kernel modules
capable of driving each <strong>Device-x</strong> (not including the
current <strong>driver:</strong>). If no non-driver modules found, shows
nothing. NOTE: just because it lists a module does NOT mean it is
available in the system, it's just something the kernel knows could
possibly be used instead.</p>
<p>- Adds PCIe generation, and, if different than running PCIe
generation, speed or lanes, <strong>link-max: gen: speed:
lanes:</strong> (only items different from primary shown).</p>
<p><strong>-a -C</strong><br />
- Adds CPU family, model-id, and stepping (replaces <strong>rev</strong>
of <strong>-Cx</strong>). Format is <strong>hexadecimal
(decimal)</strong> if greater than 9, otherwise
<strong>hexadecimal</strong>.</p>
<p>- Adds CPU microcode. Format is <strong>hexadecimal</strong>.</p>
<p>- Adds socket type (for motherboard CPU socket, if available). If
results doubtful will list two socket types and <strong>note:
check</strong>. Requires doas/sudo/root and <strong>dmidecode</strong>.
The item in parentheses may simply be a different syntax for the same
socket, but in general, check this before trusting it.</p>
<p>Sample: <strong>socket: 775 (478) note: check</strong><br />
Sample: <strong>socket: AM4</strong></p>
<p>- Adds DMI CPU base and boost/turbo speeds. Requires doas/sudo/root
and <strong>dmidecode</strong>. In some cases, like with overclocking or
'turbo' or 'boost' modes, voltage and external clock speeds may be
increased, or short term limits raised on max CPU speeds. These are
often not reflected in /sys based CPU <strong>min/max:</strong> speed
results, but often are using this source.</p>
<p>Samples:<br />
CPU not overclocked, with boost, like Ryzen:</p>
<pre><code>Speed (MHz): 
  avg: 2861 
  high: 3250 
  min/max: 1550/3400 
  boost: enabled
  base/boost: 3400/3900 </code></pre>
<p>Overclocked 2900 MHz CPU, with no boost available:</p>
<pre><code>Speed (MHz): 
  avg: 2345 
  high: 2900 
  min/max: 800/2900
  base/boost: 3350/3000</code></pre>
<p>Overclocked 3000 MHz CPU, with boosted max speed:</p>
<pre><code>Speed (MHz): 
  avg: 3260
  high: 4190
  min/max: 1200/3001
  base/boost: 3000/4000</code></pre>
<p>Note that these numbers can be confusing, but basically, the
<strong>base</strong> number is the actual normal top speed the CPU runs
at without boost mode, and the <strong>boost</strong> number is the max
speed the CPU reports itself able to run at. The actual max speed may be
higher than either value, or lower. The <strong>boost</strong> number
appears to be hard-coded into the CPU DMI data, and does not seem to
reflect actual max speeds that overclocking or other combinations of
speed boosters can enable, as you can see from the example where the CPU
is running at a speed faster than the min/max or base/boost values.</p>
<p>Note that the normal <strong>min/max:</strong> speeds do NOT show
actual overclocked OR boost/turbo mode speeds, and appear to be
hard-coded values, not dynamic real values. The
<strong>base/boost:</strong> values are sometimes real, and sometimes
not. <strong>base</strong> appears in general to be real.</p>
<p>- Adds frequency <strong>scaling: governor:.. driver:..</strong> if
found/available. Also adds scaling min/max speeds if different from
standard CPU min/max spees (not common).</p>
<p>- Adds description of cache topology per cpu. Linux only.</p>
<p>- Creates new <strong>Topology:</strong> line after the
<strong>Info:</strong> line. Moves cache data to this line from
<strong>Info:</strong> line.</p>
<p>Topology line contains, if available and/or relevant: physical CPU
count (<strong>cpus:</strong>); per physical cpu core count (cores:);
threads per core, if &gt; 1 (<strong>tpc:</strong>); how many
<strong>threads:</strong> (if more threads than cores);
<strong>dies:</strong> (rarely detected, but if so, if &gt; 1); smt
status (if no smt status found, shows <strong>N/A</strong>).</p>
<p>If complex CPU type, like Alder lake, cores; will have a more
granular breakdown of how many mt (multi-threaded) and how many st
(single-threaded) cores there in the physical cpu (
<strong>mt-cores:</strong>, <strong>st-cores:</strong>); For complex CPU
types like ARM SoC devices with 2 CPU types, with different core counts
and/or <strong>min/max:</strong>) frequencies, <strong>variant:</strong>
per type found, with relevant differences shown, like <strong>cores:,
min/max:</strong>, etc.</p>

<p>- Adds CPU Vulnerabilities (bugs) as known by your current kernel.
Lists by <strong>Type: ... (status|mitigation): ....</strong> for
systems that support this feature (Linux kernel 4.14 or newer, or
patched older kernels).</p>
<p><strong>-a -d,</strong>-a** -D**<br />
- Adds logical and physical block size in bytes.</p>
<p>Using <strong>smartctl</strong> (requires doas/sudo/root
privileges).</p>
<p>- Adds device model family, like <strong>Caviar Black</strong>, if
available.</p>
<p>- Adds SATA type (eg 1.0, 2.6, 3.0) if a SATA device.</p>
<p>- Adds device kernel major:minor number (Linux only).</p>
<p>- Adds SMART report line: status, enabled/disabled, health, powered
on, cycles, and some error cases if out of range values. Note that for
Pre-fail items, it will show the VALUE and THRESHOLD numbers. It will
also fall back for unknown attributes that are or have been failing and
print out the Attribute name, value, threshold, and failing message.
This way even for unhandled Attribute names, you should get a solid
report for full failure cases. Other cases may show if inxi believes
that the item may be approaching failure. This is a guess so make sure
to check the drive and smartctl full output to verify before taking any
further action.</p>
<p>- Adds, for USB or other external drives, actual model name/serial if
available, and different from enclosure model/serial, and corrects block
sizes if necessary. Adds in drive temperature for some drives as well,
and other useful data.</p>
<p><strong>-a -E (</strong>--bluetooth**)**<br />
- Adds (<strong>hciconfig</strong> only) extra line to
<strong>Report:</strong>, <strong>Info:</strong>. Includes, if
available, ACL MTU, SCO MTU, Link policy, Link mode, and Service
Classes.</p>
<p>- Adds PCIe generation, and, if different than running PCIe
generation, speed or lanes, <strong>link-max: gen: speed:
lanes:</strong> (only items different from primary shown. Bluetooth PCIe
rare).</p>
<p><strong>-a -G</strong><br />
- Adds, if present, possible <strong>alternate:</strong> kernel modules
capable of driving each <strong>Device-x</strong> (not including the
current <strong>loaded:</strong>). If no non-driver modules found, shows
nothing. NOTE: just because it lists a module does NOT mean it is
available in the system, it's just something the kernel knows could
possibly be used instead.</p>
<p>- Adds PCIe generation, and, if different than running PCIe
generation, speed or lanes, <strong>link-max: gen: speed:

useful to know which you need when using an unfamiliar machine.</p>
<p><strong>-a -j, <strong>-a</strong> -P [swap], <strong>-a</strong> -P
[swap]</strong><br />
- Adds swappiness and vfs cache pressure, and a message to indicate if
the value is the default value or not (Linux only, and only if
available). If not the default value, shows default value as well,
e.g.</p>
<p>For <strong>-P</strong> per swap physical partition:</p>

<p><strong>--alt 43</strong><br />
Bypass <strong>Wget</strong> as a downloader option. Priority is: Perl
(HTTP::Tiny), Curl, Wget, Fetch, OpenBSD only: ftp</p>
<p><strong>--alt 44</strong><br />
Bypass <strong>Curl</strong>, <strong>Fetch</strong>, and
<strong>Wget</strong> as downloader options. This basically forces the
downloader selection to use <strong>Perl 5.x</strong>
<strong>HTTP::Tiny</strong>, which is generally slower than
<strong>Curl</strong> or <strong>Wget</strong> but it may help bypass
issues with downloading.</p>
<p><strong>--bt-tool [bt-adapter|hciconfig|rfkill]</strong><br />
Force the use of the given tool for bluetooth report
(<strong>-E</strong>). <strong>rfkill</strong> does not support mac
address data.</p>
<p><strong>--dig</strong><br />
Temporary override of <strong>NO_DIG</strong> configuration item. Only
use to test w/wo dig. Restores default behavior for WAN IP, which is use
dig if present.</p>
<p><strong>--display [:&lt;integer&gt;]</strong><br />
Will try to get display data out of X (does not usually work as root
user). Default gets display info from display <strong>:0</strong>. If
you use the format <strong>--display :1</strong> then it would get it
from display <strong>1</strong> instead, or any display you specify.</p>
<p>Note that in some cases, <strong>--display</strong> will cause inxi
to hang endlessly when running the option in console with Intel
graphics. The situation regarding other free drivers such as nouveau/ATI
is currently unknown. It may be that this is a bug with the Intel
graphics driver - more information is required.</p>
<p>You can test this easily by running the following command out of
X/display server: <strong>glxinfo -display :0</strong></p>
<p>If it hangs, <strong>--display</strong> will not work.</p>
<p><strong>--dmidecode</strong><br />
Shortcut. See <strong>--force dmidecode</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>--downloader [curl|fetch|perl|wget]</strong><br />
Force inxi to use Curl, Fetch, Perl, or Wget for downloads.</p>
<p><strong>--force
[colors|dmidecode|hddtemp|lsusb|pkg|usb-sys|wayland|vmstat|wmctrl]</strong><br />
Various force options to allow users to override defaults. Values be
given as a comma separated list:</p>
<p><strong>inxi -MJ --force dmidecode,lsusb</strong></p>
<p>- <strong>colors</strong> - Same as <strong>-Y -2</strong> . Do not
remove colors from piped or redirected output.</p>
<p>- <strong>dmidecode</strong> - Force use of
<strong>dmidecode</strong>. This will override <strong>/sys</strong>
data in some lines, e.g. <strong>-M</strong> or <strong>-B</strong>.</p>
<p>- <strong>hddtemp</strong> - Force use of hddtemp instead of /sys
temp data for disks.</p>
<p>- <strong>lsusb</strong> - Forces the USB data generator to use
<strong>lsusb</strong> as data source (default). Overrides
<strong>USB_SYS</strong> in user configuration file(s).</p>
<p>- <strong>pkg</strong> - Force override of disabled package counts.
Known package managers with non-resolvable issues:</p>
<p>rpm: Due to up to 30 seconds delays executing</p>
<pre><code>rpm -qa --nodigest --nosignature</code></pre>
<p>on older hardware (and over 1 second on new hardware with some rpm
versions) package counts are disabled by default because of the
unacceptable slowdowns to execute a simple package list command.</p>
<p>- <strong>usb-sys</strong> - Forces the USB data generator to use
<strong>/sys</strong> as data source instead of <strong>lsusb</strong>
(Linux only).</p>
<p>- <strong>vmstat</strong> - Forces use of vmstat for memory data.</p>
<p>- <strong>wayland</strong> - Forces use of Wayland, disables x tools
glxinfo, xrandr, xdpyinfo.</p>
<p>- <strong>wmctrl</strong> - Force <strong>System</strong> item
<strong>wm</strong> to use <strong>wmctrl</strong> as data source,
override default <strong>ps</strong> source.</p>
<p><strong>--hddtemp</strong><br />
Shortcut. See <strong>--force hddtemp</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>--html-wan</strong><br />
Temporary override of <strong>NO_HTML_WAN</strong> configuration item.
Only use to test w/wo HTML downloaders for WAN IP. Restores default
behavior for WAN IP, which is use HTML downloader if present and if dig
failed.</p>
<p><strong>--man</strong><br />
Updates / installs man page with <strong>-U</strong> if
<strong>pinxi</strong> or using <strong>-U 3</strong> dev branch. (Only
active if <strong>-U</strong> is is not disabled by maintainers).</p>
<p><strong>--no-dig</strong><br />
Overrides default use of <strong>dig</strong> to get WAN IP address.
Allows use of normal downloader tool to get IP addresses. Only use if
dig is failing, since dig is much faster and more reliable in general
than other methods.</p>
<p><strong>--no-doas</strong><br />
Skips the use of doas to run certain internal features (like
<strong>hddtemp</strong>, <strong>file</strong>) with doas. Not related
to running inxi itself with doas/sudo or super user. Some systems will
register errors which will then trigger admin emails in such cases, so
if you want to disable regular user use of doas (which requires
configuration to setup anyway for these options) just use this option,
or <strong>NO_DOAS</strong> configuration item. See
<strong>--no-sudo</strong> if you need to disable both types.</p>
<p><strong>--no-html-wan</strong><br />
Overrides use of HTML downloaders to get WAN IP address. Use either only
dig, or do not get wan IP. Only use if dig is failing, and the HTML
downloaders are taking too long, or are hanging or failing.</p>
<p>Make permanent with <strong>NO_HTML_WAN='true'</strong></p>
<p><strong>--no-man</strong><br />
Disables man page install with <strong>-U</strong> for master and active
development branches. (Only active if <strong>-U</strong> is is not
disabled by maintainers).</p>
<p><strong>--no-sensor-force</strong><br />
Overrides user set <strong>SENSOR_FORCE</strong> configuration value.
Restores default behavior.</p>
<p><strong>--no-ssl</strong><br />
Skip SSL certificate checks for all downloader actions
(<strong>-U</strong>, <strong>-w</strong>, <strong>-W</strong>,
<strong>-i</strong>). Use if your system does not have current SSL
certificate lists, or if you have problems making a connection for any
reason. Works with <strong>Wget</strong>, <strong>Curl</strong>,
<strong>Perl HTTP::Tiny</strong> and <strong>Fetch</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>--no-sudo</strong><br />
Skips the use of sudo to run certain internal features (like
<strong>hddtemp</strong>, <strong>file</strong>) with sudo. Not related
to running inxi itself with sudo or superuser. Some systems will
register errors which will then trigger admin emails in such cases, so
if you want to disable regular user use of sudo (which requires
configuration to setup anyway for these options) just use this option,
or <strong>NO_SUDO</strong> configuration item.</p>
<p><strong>--pkg</strong><br />
Shortcut. See <strong>--force pkg</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>--pm-type [package manager name]</strong><br />
For distro package maintainers only, and only for non apt, rpm, or
pacman based systems. To be used to test replacement package lists for
recommends for that package manager.</p>
<p><strong>--sensors-default</strong><br />
Overrides configuration values <strong>SENSORS_USE</strong> or
<strong>SENSORS_EXCLUDE</strong> on a one time basis.</p>
<p><strong>--sensors-exclude</strong><br />
Similar to <strong>--sensors-use</strong> except removes listed sensors
from sensor data. Make permanent with <strong>SENSORS_EXCLUDE</strong>
configuration item. Note that gpu, network, disk, and other specific
device monitor chips are excluded by default.</p>
<p>Example: <strong>inxi -sxx --sensors-exclude
k10temp-pci-00c3</strong></p>
<p><strong>--sensors-use</strong><br />
Use only the (comma separated) sensor arrays for <strong>-s</strong>
output. Make permanent with <strong>SENSORS_USE</strong> configuration
item. Sensor array ID value must be the exact value shown in lm-sensors
sensors output (Linux/lm-sensors only). If you only want to exclude one
(or more) sensors from the output, use
<strong>--sensors-exclude</strong>.</p>
<p>Can be useful if the default sensor data used by inxi is not from the
right sensor array. Note that all other sensor data will be removed,
which may lead to undesired consequences. Please be aware that this can
lead to many undesirable side-effects, since default behavior is to use
all the sensors arrays and select which values to use from them
following a set sequence of rules. So if you force one to be used, you
may lose data that was used from another one.</p>
<p>Most likely best use is when one (or two) of the sensor arrays has
all the sensor data you want, and you just want to make sure inxi
doesn't use data from another array that has inaccurate or misleading
data.</p>
<p>Note that gpu, network, disk, and other specific device monitor chips
are excluded by default, and should not be added since they do not
provide cpu, board, system, etc, sensor data.</p>
<p>Example: <strong>inxi -sxx --sensors-use
nct6791-isa-0290,k10temp-pci-00c3</strong></p>
<p><strong>--sleep [0-x.x]</strong><br />
Usually in decimals. Change CPU sleep time for <strong>-C</strong>
(current: ** .35**). Sleep is used to let the system catch up and show a
more accurate CPU use. Example:</p>
<p><strong>inxi -Cxxx --sleep 0.15</strong></p>
<p>Overrides default internal value and user configuration value:</p>
<p><strong>CPU_SLEEP=0.25</strong></p>
<p><strong>--tty</strong><br />
Forces internal IRC flag to off. Used in unhandled cases where the
program running inxi may not be seen as a shell/pty/tty, but it is not
an IRC client. Put <strong>--tty</strong> first in option list to avoid
unexpected errors. If you want a specific output width, use the
<strong>--width</strong> option. If you want normal color codes in the
output, use the <strong>-c [color ID]</strong> flag.</p>
<p>The sign you need to use this is extra numbers before the key/value
pairs of the output of your program. These are IRC, not TTY, color
codes. Please post a github issue if you find you need to use
<strong>--tty</strong> (including the full <strong>-Ixxx</strong> line)
so we can figure out how to add your program to the list of whitelisted
programs.</p>
<p>You can see what inxi believed started it in the
<strong>-Ixxx</strong> line, <strong>Shell:</strong> or
<strong>Client:</strong> item. Please let us know what that result was
so we can add it to the parent start program whitelist.</p>
<p>In some cases, you may want to also use
<strong>--no-filter</strong>/<strong>-Z</strong> option if you want to
see filtered values. Filtering is turned on by default if
<strong>inxi</strong> believes it is running in an IRC client.</p>
<p><strong>--usb-sys</strong><br />
Shortcut. See <strong>--force usb-sys</strong></p>
<p><strong>--usb-tool</strong><br />
Shortcut. See <strong>--force lsusb</strong></p>
<p><strong>--wan-ip-url [URL]</strong><br />
Force <strong>-i</strong> to use supplied URL as WAN IP source.
Overrides dig or default IP source urls. URL must start with http[s] or
ftp.</p>
<p>The IP address from the URL must be the last item on the last
(non-empty) line of the page content source code.</p>
<p>Same as configuration value (example):</p>
<p><strong>WAN_IP_URL='<a
href="https://mysite.com/ip.php&#39;">https://mysite.com/ip.php'</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>--wayland, <strong>--wl</strong></strong><br />
Shortcut. See <strong>--force wayland</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>--wm</strong><br />
Shortcut. See <strong>--force wmctl</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="supported-irc-clients">Supported irc clients</h2>
<p>BitchX, Gaim/Pidgin, ircII, Irssi, Konversation, Kopete, KSirc,
KVIrc, Weechat, and Xchat. Plus any others that are capable of
displaying either built-in or external script output.</p>
<h2 id="running-in-irc-client">Running in irc client</h2>
<p>To trigger inxi output in your IRC client, pick the appropriate
method from the list below:</p>
<p><strong>Hexchat, XChat, Irssi</strong><br />
(and many other IRC clients) <strong>/exec -o inxi
[<strong>options</strong>]</strong> If you don't include the
<strong>-o</strong>, only you will see the output on your local IRC
client.</p>
<p><strong>Konversation</strong><br />
<strong>/cmd inxi</strong> [<strong>options</strong>]</p>
<p>To run inxi in Konversation as a native script if your distribution
or inxi package hasn't already done this for you, create this symbolic
link:</p>
<p>KDE 4: <strong>ln -s /usr/local/bin/inxi
/usr/share/kde4/apps/konversation/scripts/inxi</strong></p>
<p>KDE 5: <strong>ln -s /usr/local/bin/inxi
/usr/share/konversation/scripts/inxi</strong></p>
<p>If inxi is somewhere else, change the path
<strong>/usr/local/bin</strong> to wherever it is located.</p>
<p>If you are using KDE/QT 5, then you may also need to add the
following to get the Konversation /inxi command to work:</p>
<p><strong>ln -s /usr/share/konversation /usr/share/apps/</strong></p>
<p>Then you can start inxi directly, like this:</p>
<p><strong>/inxi</strong> [<strong>options</strong>]</p>
<p><strong>WeeChat</strong><br />
<strong>NEW: /exec -o inxi</strong> [<strong>options</strong>]</p>
<p><strong>OLD: /shell -o inxi</strong> [<strong>options</strong>]</p>
<p>Newer (2014 and later) WeeChats work pretty much the same now as
other console IRC clients, with **/exec -o inxi
**[<strong>options</strong>]. Newer WeeChats have dropped the
<strong>-curses</strong> part of their program name, i.e.:
<strong>weechat</strong> instead of <strong>weechat-curses</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="configuration-file">Configuration file</h2>
<p>inxi will read its configuration/initialization files in the
following order:</p>
<p><strong>/etc/inxi.conf</strong> contains the default configurations.
These can be overridden by creating a
<strong>/etc/inxi.d/inxi.conf</strong> file (global override, which will
prevent distro packages from changing or overwriting your edits. This
method is recommended if you are using a distro packaged inxi and want
to override some configuration items from the package's default
<strong>/etc/inxi.conf</strong> file but don't want to lose your changes
on a package update.</p>
<p>You can old override, per user, with a user configuration file found
in one of the following locations (inxi will store its config file using
the following precedence:</p>
<p>if <strong>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</strong> is not empty, it will go there,
else if <strong>$HOME/.conf/inxi.conf</strong> exists, it will go there,
and as a last default, the legacy location is used), i.e.:</p>
<p><strong>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/inxi.conf</strong> &gt;
<strong>$HOME/.conf/inxi.conf</strong> &gt;
<strong>$HOME/.inxi/inxi.conf</strong></p>
<h2 id="configuration-options">Configuration options</h2>
<p>See the documentation page for more complete information on how to
set these up, and for a complete list of options:</p>
<p><em><a
href="https://smxi.org/docs/inxi-configuration.htm">https://smxi.org/docs/inxi-configuration.htm</a></em></p>
<p><strong>Basic Options</strong><br />
Here's a brief overview of the basic options you are likely to want to
use:</p>
<p><strong>COLS_MAX_CONSOLE</strong> The max display column width on
terminal. If terminal/console width or <strong>--width</strong> is less
than wrap width, wrapping of line starter occurs</p>
<p><strong>COLS_MAX_IRC</strong> The max display column width on IRC
clients.</p>
<p><strong>COLS_MAX_NO_DISPLAY</strong> The max display column width in
out of X / Wayland / desktop / window manager.</p>
<p><strong>CPU_SLEEP</strong> Decimal value <strong>0</strong> or more.
Default is usually around <strong>0.35</strong> seconds. Time that inxi
will 'sleep' before getting CPU speed data, so that it reflects actual
system state.</p>
<p><strong>DOWNLOADER</strong> Sets default inxi downloader: curl,
fetch, ftp, perl, wget. See <strong>--recommends</strong> output for
more information on downloaders and Perl downloaders.</p>
<p><strong>FILTER_STRING</strong> Default
<strong>&lt;filter&gt;</strong>. Any string you prefer to see instead
for filtered values.</p>
<p><strong>INDENT</strong> Change primary indent width of wide mode
output. See <strong>--indent</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>INDENTS</strong> Change primary indents of narrow wrapped
mode output, and second level indents. See
<strong>--indents</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>LIMIT</strong> Overrides default of <strong>10</strong> IP
addresses per IF. This is only of interest to sys admins running servers
with many IP addresses.</p>
<p><strong>LINES_MAX</strong> Values: [-2-xxx]. See <strong>-Y</strong>
for explanation and values. Use <strong>-Y -3</strong> to restore
default unlimited output lines. Avoid using this in general unless the
machine is a headless system and you want the output to be always
controlled.</p>
<p><strong>MAX_WRAP</strong> (or <strong>WRAP_MAX</strong>) The maximum
width where the line starter wraps to its own line. If terminal/console
width or <strong>--width</strong> is less than wrap width, wrapping of
line starter occurs. Overrides default. See <strong>--max-wrap</strong>.
If <strong>80</strong> or less, wrap will never happen.</p>
<p><strong>NO_DIG</strong> Set to <strong>1</strong> or
<strong>true</strong> to disable WAN IP use of <strong>dig</strong> and
force use of alternate downloaders.</p>
<p><strong>NO_DOAS</strong> Set to <strong>1</strong> or
<strong>true</strong> to disable internal use of
<strong>doas</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>NO_HTML_WAN</strong> Set to <strong>1</strong> or
<strong>true</strong> to disable WAN IP use of <strong>HTML
Downloaders</strong> and force use of dig only, or nothing if dig
disabled as well. Same as <strong>--no-html-wan</strong>. Only use if
dig is failing, and HTML downloaders are hanging.</p>
<p><strong>NO_SUDO</strong> Set to <strong>1</strong> or
<strong>true</strong> to disable internal use of
<strong>sudo</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>PARTITION_SORT</strong> Overrides default partition output
sort. See <strong>--partition-sort</strong> for options.</p>
<p><strong>PS_COUNT</strong> The default number of items showing per
<strong>-t</strong> type, <strong>m</strong> or <strong>c</strong>.
Default is 5.</p>
<p><strong>SENSORS_CPU_NO</strong> In cases of ambiguous temp1/temp2
(inxi can't figure out which is the CPU), forces sensors to use either
value 1 or 2 as CPU temperature. See the above configuration page on
smxi.org for full info.</p>
<p><strong>SENSORS_EXCLUDE</strong> Exclude supplied sensor array[s]
from sensor output. Override with <strong>--sensors-default</strong>.
See <strong>--sensors-exclude</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>SENSORS_USE</strong> Use only supplied sensor array[s].
Override with <strong>--sensors-default</strong>. See
<strong>--sensors-use</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>SEP2_CONSOLE</strong> Replaces default key / value separator
of '<strong>:</strong>'.</p>
<p><strong>USB_SYS</strong> Forces all USB data to use
<strong>/sys</strong> instead of <strong>lsusb</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>WAN_IP_URL</strong> Forces <strong>-i</strong> to use
supplied URL, and to not use dig (dig is generally much faster). URL
must begin with http or ftp. Note that if you use this, the downloader
set tests will run each time you start inxi whether a downloader feature
is going to be used or not.</p>
<p>The IP address from the URL must be the last item on the last
(non-empty) line of the URL's page content source code.</p>
<p>Same as <strong>--wan-ip-url [URL]</strong></p>
<p><strong>WEATHER_SOURCE</strong> Values: [<strong>0-9</strong>]. Same
as <strong>--weather-source</strong>. Values 4-9 are not currently
supported, but this can change at any time.</p>
<p><strong>WEATHER_UNIT</strong> Values:
[<strong>m</strong>|<strong>i</strong>|<strong>mi</strong>|<strong>im</strong>].
Same as <strong>--weather-unit</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Color Options</strong><br />
It's best to use the <strong>-c [94-99]</strong> color selector tool to
set the following values because it will correctly update the
configuration file and remove any invalid or conflicting items, but if
you prefer to create your own configuration files, here are the options.
All take the integer value from the options available in <strong>-c
94-99</strong>.</p>
<p>NOTE: All default and configuration file set color values are removed
when output is piped or redirected. You must use the explicit <strong>-c
&lt;color number&gt;</strong> option if you want colors to be present in
the piped/redirected output (creating a PDF for example).</p>
<p><strong>CONSOLE_COLOR_SCHEME</strong> The color scheme for console
output (not in X/Wayland).</p>
<p><strong>GLOBAL_COLOR_SCHEME</strong> Overrides all other color
schemes.</p>
<p><strong>IRC_COLOR_SCHEME</strong> Desktop X/Wayland IRC CLI color
scheme.</p>
<p><strong>IRC_CONS_COLOR_SCHEME</strong> Out of X/Wayland, IRC CLI
color scheme.</p>
<p><strong>IRC_X_TERM_COLOR_SCHEME</strong> In X/Wayland IRC client
terminal color scheme.</p>
<p><strong>VIRT_TERM_COLOR_SCHEME</strong> Color scheme for virtual
terminal output (in X/Wayland).</p>
<h2 id="bugs">Bugs</h2>
<p>Please report bugs using the following resources.</p>
<p>You may be asked to run the inxi debugger tool (see <strong>--debug
21/22</strong>), which will upload a data dump of system files for use
in debugging inxi. These data dumps are very important since they
provide us with all the real system data inxi uses to parse out its
report.</p>

<h2 id="special-thanks-to-the-following">Special thanks to the
following</h2>
<p>The nice people at irc.oftc.net channels #linux-smokers-club and
#smxi, who all really have to be considered to be co-developers because
of their non-stop enthusiasm and willingness to provide real-time
testing and debugging of inxi development over the years.</p>
<p>LinuxQuestions.org Slackware forum members, for major help with
development and debugging new or refactored features, particularly the
redone CPU logic of 2021-12.</p>
<p>Siduction forum members, who have helped get some features working by
providing a large number of datasets that have revealed possible
variations, particularly for the RAM <strong>-m</strong> option.</p>
<p>AntiX users and admins, who have helped greatly with testing and
debugging, particularly for the 3.0.0 release.</p>
<p>ArcherSeven (Max), Brett Bohnenkamper (aka KittyKatt), and Iotaka,
who always manage to find the weirdest or most extreme hardware and
setups that help make inxi much more robust.</p>
<p>For the vastly underrated skill of output error/glitch catching, Pete
Haddow. His patience and focus in going through inxi repeatedly to find
errors and inconsistencies is much appreciated.</p>
<p>For a huge boost to BSD support, Stan Vandiver, who did a lot of
testing and setup many remote access systems for testing and
development.</p>
<p>All the inxi package maintainers, distro support people, forum
moderators, and in particular, sys admins with their particular issues,
which almost always help make inxi better, and any others who contribute
ideas, suggestions, and patches.</p>
<p>Without a wide range of diverse Linux kernel-based Free Desktop
systems to test on, we could never have gotten inxi to be as reliable
and solid as it's turning out to be.</p>
<p>And of course, a big thanks to locsmif, who figured out a lot of the
core ideas, logic, and tricks originally used in inxi Gawk/Bash.</p>
