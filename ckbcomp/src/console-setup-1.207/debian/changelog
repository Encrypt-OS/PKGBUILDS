  * ckbcomp: When translating X symbols to kernel symbols, ignore Unicode
    code points above 0xFFFF. Those code points aren’t supported by the
    Linux kernel, so loadkeys won’t be able to load them, or even parse
    the value. This affects the fr(bepo_afnor) keymap, which includes the
    copyleft symbol U+1F12F.
    Thanks to Jean-Louis Biasini for the bug report and Anisse Astier for the
    initial patch. (Closes: #968195)

  * Changes in setupcon:
    - new option -t|--terminal-only.  The functionality of the
      old command 'setupcon -f' is now covered by 'setupcon -f -t';
    - new options --current-tty and --print-commands-only;
    - on Linux 'setupcon --save' creates in /etc/console-setup/
      configuration scripts for faster boot configuration;
    - on Linux load the font and the console map using only one
      setfont command;
    - when the keyboard model is unknown, use a default value and
      issue a warning.  Closes: #751955, #788441.  Apply a patch about
      KMAP by Michal Maruska;
    - more robust test whether /etc is writable, closes: #810246;
    - setup-dir: configure only the keyboard and only the current
      console.  Create a flag file /run/console-setup/keymap_loaded so
      that we can avoid loading the keyboard second time.
  * Changes in ckbcomp:
    - remove the 'use locale' pragma as suggested by Klaus Ethgen.
      Closes: #810538.
  * kbdcompiler: create a log file ckbcomp.log.
  * On Linux: use precomputed scripts and Udev to configure the console.
    Closes: #759657, #763695.
  * On Linux: move init.d/console-setup.sh out of single user mode.
    Closes: #796603, #816090.
  * Move the init scripts from keyboard-configuration to
    console-setup-linux and console-setup-freebsd.  Closes: #805928.
    Give them a .sh extension to make them sourcable.  Move the
    dependency on initscripts to these two packages.  Closes: #804988.
  * postinst: run update-rc.d with parameter 'defaults'. Closes: #722064.
  * Put db_stop near the end of console-setup.postinst.  Redirect all
    output of setupcon to /dev/null.  Hopefully, this
    closes: #782753, #776101.
  * debian/keyboard_present.sh: add a pattern for Bluetooth keyboards,
    closes: #807945.
  * keyboard-configuration.config: the Serbian keyboard layout is 'rs',
    not 'cs'.  For Bulgarian consider bg,bg as unsupported by Debconf.  Do
    not set default variant 'bds' for Bulgarian or 'latin' for Serbian but
    use default values instead.  Closes: #778721, #778722.
  * Remove Keyboard/locale/lib/ from the source package.  Closes: #787528
  * bug-control: add systemd to the packages in the package-status list.

  * Prefer console-tools to kbd if both utilities are installed.  This is
    wrong as kbd is better but these days only Debian provides

  * README: /etc/getty=>/etc/gettytab
  * debian/*.init: source /etc/default/locale to permit autodetection of
    the charmap when console-setup-mini operates without configuration
    file.
  * debian/*.init: do not test whether we are on the console, there are
    better tests inside setupcon.
  * setupcon: do not expect the existence of 'tty' (if /usr is not mounted
    'tty' will be unavailable).  Thanks to Sven Joachim, closes: #619462.
  * README.Debian: console-setup-mini no longer installs only a minimal
    set of fonts.  Without configuration file no font will be loaded.
  * A little Lintian cleaning:
    - copyright: add the required reference to common-licenses;
    - restore the separate copyright file for bdf2psf;
    - versioned build dependency on debhelper (>=7.2.3~) for dh_bugfiles;
    - standards version 3.9.1;
    - use dh_lintian to install the override file.
  * setupcon: new options --save-keyboard and --setup-dir.  Keep them
    undocumented for now.
  * setupcon: some bug fixing:
    - the function findfile wouldn't work when setupcon is not run from
      /bin or /usr/local/bin, but from a non-standard location;
    - when working with incomplete information and guessing the font name,
      use [A-WXYZa-wyz] as file pattern for fonts instead of [A-Za-z] (we do
      not want 'x' and in some locales [A-Z] includes 'x').
  * Use all-permissive, non-copyleft license for setupcon and ckbcomp-mini.

    for keyboard-configuration, console-setup-linux,
    console-setup-freebsd, console-setup and console-setup-mini.  New
    README.Debian.  Thanks to Jorgen Grahn, closes: #617580.
  * Remove most of the comments in the default configuration files.  It is
    difficult to update these comments when the functionality of
    console-setup changes and the new manual pages make these comments
    less necessary.
  * Remove the VERBOSE_OUTPUT option from the default configuration file
    (but it is still supported).
  * Install *.bug-control files for reportbug.
  * Ask the keyboard option question even when Debconf doesn't support the
    layout.  Thanks to Petr Baudis and Julien Cristau, closes: #581758.
  * ckbcomp_mini: process properly empty layout and/or variant options.
    Thanks to Baptiste Carvello who reported the problem and traced its
    source.  Closes: #617499.
  * ckbcomp: ignore actions[...] = ... specifications in key definitions.
    Thanks to Klaus Ethgen, closes: #607532.
  * setupcon: accept all methods to state font size in the configuration
    file (8x14, 14x8, 14).
  * Debconf: More human-friendly options for the font size question.  By
    default use 8x14 format for all sizes.
  * setupcon: Improved test whether we are on the console.  Thanks to
    Michael Schutte and Julien Cristau for the suggestions.
  * console-setup(-mini).postinst: add again commands to configure the
    console.
  * ckbcomp: improved implementation for Alt+PrintScreen=SysRq and
    Ctrl+Pause=Break on AT keyboards.
  * ckbcomp: more correct use of approximate().  This probably affects
    only some exotic key combination such as Ctrl+Alt+Shift+AltGr+F1.
  * ckbcomp: lets try to remove some unnecessary and potentialy harmful on
    non-standard layouts mappings for Linux (Ctrl+'=^G, Ctrl+3=^[,
    Ctrl+4=^\, Ctrl+5=^], Ctrl+7=^_, Ctrl+8=^?).
  * Do not source /etc/default/keyboard in /etc/default/console-setup
    (on new installs or upgrades from pre 1.47 versions).
  * setupcon: do not cache automatically the keymap.  Instead add --save
    option the init script.
  * Do not remove /etc/console-setup in postrm.
  * setupcon, config, postinst: recognise 'guess' value in the
    configuration file.
  * postinst: do not fail if setupcon fails.
  * Include Terminus font in the compiled packages.  Do not depend, but
    conflict and provide console-terminus.  New upstream version of the
    Terminus font (4.32).
  * Keyboard/ckb: update with keyboard data of version 2.1 of xkb files.
    (This change is not relevant for Debian.)
  * New install targets in the Makefiles and debian/rules to better
    support non-Debian installs.
  * Support for FreeBSD.  Packages for Debian GNU/kFreeBSD:
    - bdf2psf: new option --raw to generate raw fonts.  Try to use CP437
      code positions if possible.  When generating raw fonts with same
      codeset, use identical font map.
    - ckbcomp and setupcon: support for FreeBSD keymaps.
    - ckbcomp: new option -backspace [ del | bs ] to determine the
      behaviour of the keys BackSpace and Delete.
    - setupcon, postinst: A corresponding variable BACKSPACE in
      /etc/default/keyboard.
    - Termcap and Terminfo entries for FreeBSD.
    - setupcon: When UTF-8 is requested on FreeBSD, act as if the encoding
      is ISO-8859-1.
    - Debconf: Don't ask the question about font size on kFreeBSD (no need
      for this -- all available sizes will be loaded).
    - New configuration variable VIDEOMODE.  Currently it is most useful
      on FreeBSD because the default Linux framebuffer driver (VesaFB)
      doesn't permit changes of the videomode.
    - Support for 8-bit encodings in console-setup-mini and in the udebs
    - Udebs for kFreeBSD.

  * Merge from Ubuntu:
    - Fix property counts in Goha and legacy BDF fonts.
    - Fix keymap reduction not to try to express keymap A in terms of keymap
      B when B includes keys not mapped by A.
    - If reading a user configuration file, disable --save, and don't use
      /etc/console-setup/cached.kmap.gz; using the cached file tends to
      cause confusion here since the maintainer scripts and init scripts are
      expecting that to correspond to the main configuration (LP: #332728).
    - Raise priority to critical for questions preseeded with a nonexistent

  * Sort the null variant to the top of the choices list rather than to the
    bottom.
  * Make %.ekmap target depend on MyKeyboardNames.pl.

console-setup (1.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove the udebs in order to make the migration from unstable to
    testing automatic.
  * Update the version of the Terminus font from 4.16 to 4.20.  (This is
    not important for Debian, since in Debian the Terminus font is
    provided by the console-terminus package.)
  * New mini-font georgian16.bdf to be used for the Georgian letters in
    Fixed16, author: Gia Shervashidze.  Thanks to Vladimer Sichinava.
  * Add FAQ.  Thanks to Thue Janus Kristensen, closes: #389963, #389970.
  * Fix two problems reported by Martin-Éric Racine.  Closes: #393850.
    - console-setup-mini should not ask questions in debconf for the encoding
      since only UTF-8 is supported.
    - make the purpose of the codeset question clearer.
  * Use user-friendly choices in the codeset question.
  * Updated Bulgarian translation of the templates.
  * Add some capital Greek letters to standard.equivalents and approximate
    BOX DRAWINGS HEAVY HORIZONTAL by BOX DRAWINGS LIGHT HORIZONTAL.
  * Make the bullet to be the first symbol in useful.set - it is used by w3m.

console-setup (1.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * setupcon: new option --force to skip the 'are we on the console'
    check.  To be used for d-i because there /proc/self/fd/2 points to
    pipe.  Thanks to Tollef Fog Heen.
  * config.proto: Handle C locale with debian-installer/locale not being
    available.  Thanks to Colin Watson for the bug report and the patch,
    closes: #386835.
  * config.proto: Handle properly the case when the user backs up from the
    first Debconf question.  In the template file change "none" to "this
    default value is completely ignored".  Thanks to Colin Watson,
    closes: #386837.
  * Handle properly the cs layout in config.proto and kbdcompiler.  Thanks
    to Colin Watson, closes: #386838.
  * Supply correct debian/po/POTFILES.in.  Thanks to Thomas Huriaux,
    closes: #387631.
  * Use /lib/lsb/init-functions in the init scripts when available.
    Thanks to Colin Watson, closes: #386844.
  * config.proto: Try to use the value of debian-installer/keymap to get
    default keyboard layout and variant and when that is possible ask the
    corresponding Debconf questions with medium instead of critical
    priority.  Thanks to Colin Watson, closes: #386836.
  * config.proto(ask_debconf): when the provided default value is
    unavailable, try to use the empty string.  Useful when asking for the
    keyboard variant.
  * Add README.Debian for console-setup.
  * Add boot script order header to the init scripts.  Thanks to
    Martin-Éric Racine, closes: #386545.

  [ Christian Perrier ]
  * Updated French translation
  * Added Czech translation. Closes: #360333

  [ Anton Zinoviev ]
  * Keyboard/ckbcomp: include /usr/share/X11/xkb to the list of
    directories for keyboard data.  The data from /etc/console-setup/ckb
    are still the default.

    0.8-5.  Update ckbcomp with two new keysyms (Cyrillic_(CHE|KA)_vertbar).
  * Do not package the keyboard data.  Depend on xkb-data.  Thanks to
    Denis Barbier, closes: #359775.
  * Fix a shell syntax error in debian/config.proto that causes
    installation of console-setup to hang on powerpc.  Thanks to Colin
    Watson, closes: #374765.

console-setup (1.6) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Anton Zinoviev ]
  * Few comments in debian/templates.
  * Document in console-setup/fontsize-fb template that non 8-pixel wide
    fonts can not be used with console-tools.  Add a warning in setupcon
    if the user tries to use such fonts with console-tools.  Thanks to
    Hans Ulrich Niedermann, closes: #352911.
  * debian/postinst: protect in double quotes the variables read from
    $CONFIGFILE.  Thanks to Jonas Meurer, closes: #353525.
  * ckbcomp: Do not interpret xkeysyms such as F10, F11 and F12 as
    hexadecimal numbers.  Thanks to Bálint Balogh, closes: #354564.

    of XKBOPTIONS in /etc/default/console-setup.  Thanks to Javier Kohen,
    closes: #354473.
  * Updated Bulgarian translation.

  [ Christian Perrier ]

console-setup (1.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * In the Debconf question for the font size add an information that some
    of the font sizes are non available in text mode and with radeonfb.
    Thanks to Hans Ulrich Niedermann, closes: #352911.

 -- Anton Zinoviev <zinoviev@debian.org>  Wed, 15 Feb 2006 12:22:04 +0200

console-setup (1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make debconf templates a bit less verbose.  Make them compliant with
    writing style recommended in the developers references.  Thanks to
    Christian Perrier for the patch, closes: #352772.

 -- Anton Zinoviev <zinoviev@debian.org>  Tue, 14 Feb 2006 20:52:24 +0200

console-setup (1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make the Debconf config script not override the user's answers with
    default values when executed at postinst time.  Thanks to Juhapekka
    Tolvanen, closes: #352299.

 -- Anton Zinoviev <zinoviev@debian.org>  Mon, 13 Feb 2006 21:41:20 +0200

console-setup (1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix some bugs related to non-UTF8 modes:
    - setupcon always sets up the first console in UTF-8 mode
    - setupcon doesn't load ACM in the first console if kbd is used
    - ckbcomp has to interpret the "acute" Xkeysym as apostrophe.
    Thanks to Norbert Preining, closes: #352449.

 -- Anton Zinoviev <zinoviev@debian.org>  Mon, 13 Feb 2006 21:37:42 +0200

console-setup (1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Run setupcon in postinst.  Thanks to Recai Oktaş for the suggestion.
  * Setupcon uses /proc/self/fd/2 (standard error) instead of
    /proc/self/fd/0 (standard output) in order to determine whether we are
    on the console or not.  That way setupcon can detect that we are on
    the console even when it is invoked from postinst and Debconf has
    changed standard input and output.
  * Changes in the text of some questions: "What is the origin of our
    keyboard" instead of "What is the layout of your keyboard" and "What
    is the layout of your keyboard" instead of "What is the variant of
    your keyboard".  Ask the console-setup/variant question with critical
    priority.  Thanks to Arnt Karlsen, closes: #352405.
  * Fix the true/yes discrepancy in setupcon which caused the options -k
    and -f not to work.
  * Updated Bulgarian translation.

 -- Anton Zinoviev <zinoviev@debian.org>  Sat, 11 Feb 2006 23:24:54 +0200
