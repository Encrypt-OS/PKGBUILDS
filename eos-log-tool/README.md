## Use cases

If a user wants help in troubleshooting an issue, with this tool user
can share logs for other users to see e.g. on the Encrypt-OS forum.<br>
Note that without logs and/or other system information troubleshooting can be practically impossible.

This tool aims to hide all personal information from the logs that will be sent to the internet when the<br>
**Remove personal data from logs** is selected.

If **Send logs to internet** is selected, then the logs will be sent to the internet, and an <u>URL</u> is returned after a successful send.<br>
This <u>URL</u> is the thing to share with others that help troubleshooting the issue.
